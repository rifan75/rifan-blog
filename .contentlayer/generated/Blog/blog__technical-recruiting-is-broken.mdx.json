If they did,\r\nI wouldn't get emails like this.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Amazon Recruiter`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/technical-recruiting-is-broken/amazon.jpg`}\r\n  width={1784}\r\n  height={1222}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nI explicitly list what I _don't_ want, yet still, get tons of recruiter spam. Why is this?\r\n\r\n## Buying vs. Selling\r\n\r\nHiring is becoming increasingly more difficult, especially in a place with a [limited talent pool](https://innovationia.com/2019/01/03/dsmtech-io-launches-for-tech-job-seekers-scouting-des-moines/) and\r\nthe [lowest unemployment rate](https://whotv.com/2019/01/22/iowa-now-has-the-lowest-unemployment-rate-in-the-nation/) in the nation (2.4%).\r\nThis leads to companies outsourcing or supplementing hiring by working with third parties.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is: **the people you're trying to recruit already have a job**. The focus needs to be on\r\n_selling them_ the position. Let's take a look at some examples. What kind of subject line works best?\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Recruiter Email`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/technical-recruiting-is-broken/recruiter2.jpg`}\r\n  width={1224}\r\n  height={548}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nWhat does that even mean?

When a recruiter leaves a positive impression,\r\nI'm more likely to return to them when the timing is right.\r\n\r\nRather than dwell on the negatives, I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight some positive messages I've received\r\nfrom recruiters and CEOs.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Technical Recruiter`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/technical-recruiting-is-broken/derek.jpg`}\r\n  width={976}\r\n  height={414}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n- He creates a personal connection by reference my writing he's read\r\n- He compliments me on my skill sets\r\n- He asks to _learn about me_ instead of plugging a specific job\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Technical Recruiter`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/technical-recruiting-is-broken/alexa.jpg`}\r\n  width={1638}\r\n  height={578}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n- She captures my attention with a great subject line\r\n- She read my profile to see that I'm into music\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Technical Recruiter`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/technical-recruiting-is-broken/katie.jpg`}\r\n  width={972}\r\n  height={482}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n- She understands the [benefits I'm looking for](/blog/benefits-i-care-about-in-2019) by reading my blog\r\n- She offers to connect me with a developer\r\n\r\n## Takeaways\r\n\r\n_What can recruiters do to fix technical recruiting?_\r\n\r\n- Make genuine, personal connections\r\n- Focus on building relationships more than solving immediate needs\r\n- Do your research on candidates (look at their website, read their blog, etc)\r\n\r\n_What can recruitees do?_\r\n\r\n- Just because there are bad recruiters out there does not mean they're all bad - acknowledge and support those who recruit well and develop relationships\r\n- Clearly state what you're looking for and what you don't want\r\n- No false advertising - be able to speak to everything on your resume and LinkedIn\r\n\r\nSee more discussion on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/arn2pg/technical_recruiting_is_broken/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19185816).\r\n",
