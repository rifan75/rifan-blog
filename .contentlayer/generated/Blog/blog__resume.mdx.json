    "raw": "\r\nOver the years, I've had many resume iterations. As I moved into my [new role](/blog/2019) last month, I went to update my resume ‚Äî That's when I realized it was terrible.\r\n\r\nThis is going to be a sort of _resume retrospective_. Basically, I'm just going to roast myself. Laugh at my mistakes and learn from my failures.\r\n\r\n## 2016 Resume\r\n\r\nThis was my resume out of college which helped me land my first full-time engineering job. There were more resume iterations before this, obviously, but they were terrible.\r\nLet me save _some_ dignity.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`2016 Resume`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/resume/2016.jpg`}\r\n  width={956}\r\n  height={1241}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nOkay, I'll start with the **good**.\r\n\r\n- It's one page. The layout is clean and comfortable to read. Good job, Lee.\r\n- The job title is more prominent than the employer.\r\n- Most bullet points are useful (not too much content).\r\n- Projects and GPA are still relevant because I'm fresh out of college.\r\n\r\nWhat about the **bad**?\r\n\r\n- This thing is written with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). Why? Because that's what everyone on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions) did. Talk about over-engineering.\r\n- My middle name is not relevant. My name isn't that generic.\r\n- My phone number is not needed. This trend persisted for a while.\r\n- Some of the bullet points talk about _what_ I did instead of the _impact_ I made.\r\n- \"Videographer\" is not relevant to the position I'm interviewing for.\r\n\r\n## 2017 Resume\r\n\r\nIn 2017, I got the bright idea to re-design my resume. The content didn't change much.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`2017 Resume`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/resume/2017.jpg`}\r\n  width={961}\r\n  height={1244}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThere's some **good**:\r\n\r\n- At a glance, you can quickly parse the content.\r\n- Easy to read font.\r\n- Education moved down now that I have a full-time job.\r\n\r\nThere are some **issues**, though:\r\n\r\n- This custom Photoshop design did _not_ work well with Applicant Tracking Systems, or [ATS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system) for short. Which is, ya know, the whole point ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\r\n- The location of the companies is not relevant.\r\n\r\n## 2018 Resume\r\n\r\nIn 2018, [I switched jobs](/blog/joining-hy-vee). Time to dust off the ol' resume. But, just when you thought it couldn't get worse...\r\n\r\n**I made this thing with InDesign**.\r\n\r\nIt had an embedded font. Well, it turns out the embedded font didn't work in Firefox. So the resume was basically unreadable in some cases.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`2018 Resume`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/resume/2018.jpg`}\r\n  width={961}\r\n  height={1245}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nI don't have much good to say here, so let's just go straight to the **bad**:\r\n\r\n- The about section is a complete waste of space. Save it for [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leejamesrobinson/).\r\n- References are not needed on the resume.\r\n- I'm not sure why I decided to drop the start and end dates from my work positions. \"3 years\" isn't very descriptive.\r\n- The GitHub link is unnecessary. You can find it on my website.\r\n\r\n## 2019 Resume\r\n\r\nBrace yourself. We've now reached peak monstrosity.\r\n\r\nI finally gave up on custom designs and opted to use a service called [Standard Resume](https://standardresume.co/). It was easy, required little maintenance, and worked much better with ATS.\r\n\r\nPlus, I thought, let's add every single thing I've ever accomplished. I committed the ultimate sin. **I made a two-page resume.**\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`2019 Resume`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/resume/2019.jpg`}\r\n  width={887}\r\n  height={2187}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nSome things are **good**:\r\n\r\n- The skills section made a comeback. ATS love those buzzwords.\r\n- Some of the newer bullet points have excellent metrics.\r\n- It's a wonderful design. Easy to read.\r\n\r\nBut others are **bad**. Really bad:\r\n\r\n- I've been out of college long enough that I can drop the internships.\r\n- Instead of putting freelance dev work, I put a project ([dsmtech](https://dsmtech.io)).\r\n- GPA is not relevant anymore. Then again... was it ever relevant?\r\n- Did I mention it's 2 pages? No one has time for that.\r\n\r\n## 2020 Resume\r\n\r\nThat brings us [to now](/robinson-resume-2019.pdf). Behold, this single sheet of (digital) paper.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`2020 Resume`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/resume/2020.jpg`}\r\n  width={960}\r\n  height={1243}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nI made this with Pages on Mac. No custom fonts. No crazy design.\r\nI'd like to think it's the culmination of all the points made above.\r\n\r\n- It's easy to update and maintain.\r\n- The font is readable, and there's a good use of bold and italic.\r\n- Unnecessary information is omitted (GPA, projects, internships, phone number).\r\n- More relevant information is included (skills, freelance work).\r\n- Industry normalized job title (Software Engineer III -> Senior Software Engineer).\r\n- There are clear start/end dates with the same format throughout.\r\n- Proper use of whitespace.\r\n\r\nYou don't need a two-page resume.\r\n",
