You're applying for a new job. You submit your resume to Big Name Co‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. After glancing at it for 10 seconds, what does the hiring manager do?\r\n\r\n**They Google you.**\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Google`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/google.gif`}\r\n  width={1190}\r\n  height={108}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nHave you ever Googled yourself? Based on your online footprint and the uniqueness of your name, you may or may not show up on the first page. What if there was a way to improve your online presence and build your personal brand?\r\n\r\n### What Is Content Marketing?\r\n\r\nOne strategy to build your personal brand is called [content marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_marketing).\r\n\r\n> Content marketing is a form of marketing focused on creating, publishing, and distributing content for a targeted audience online.\r\n\r\nTypically, content marketing is used to attract and transform viewers into customers, but what if you're not selling anything?\r\n\r\nYou might not be explicitly selling a product, but you are **selling yourself**. You should view yourself as a business, and successful businesses usually have some form of marketing.\r\n\r\n### Why Should I Use Content Marketing?\r\n\r\nFor me personally, I learn best by _doing_. I wanted to drive more content to my portfolio, but I wasn't sure how. I decided to put more focus on creating informative, high-quality content in the form of blog posts. The results have been pretty staggering.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing my last post, [How Stripe Designs Beautiful Websites](/blog/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites), I posted a link to the article on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Article Initially Posted`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/originally-posted.png`}\r\n  width={1913}\r\n  height={589}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nI was immediately receiving 10x the traffic as before. The article ended up hitting #1 on Hacker News and [/r/web_design](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/).\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`#1 Hacker News Article`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/hacker-news.png`}\r\n  width={1680}\r\n  height={184}\r\n/>\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`#1 Reddit Article`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/reddit.png`}\r\n  width={1680}\r\n  height={184}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThis ultimately led to the article being reposted across a bunch of different websites. It continued to grow organically throughout the day, bringing in ~70,000 views in 24 hours.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Article Initially Posted`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/final-views.png`}\r\n  width={955}\r\n  height={472}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThis traffic created two notable events:\r\n\r\n- My average site traffic doubled\r\n- My portfolio moved from the 3rd page of Google to the 1st\r\n\r\nYou might be thinking \"That's great Lee, but would it work for me?\"\r\n\r\n### Who Is This For?\r\n\r\n- Are you looking for a new job?\r\n- Are you trying to network with your peers?\r\n- Do you aspire to become a [thought leader](http://randsinrepose.com/dont-skip-this/) in your industry?\r\n- Is your name Michael?\r\n\r\n_Just kidding_, reader named Michael who is a little freaked out right now.\r\n\r\nIf you answered yes to any of those questions, this article is for you. Let's use Michael as an example (Sorry Michael).\r\n\r\nMichael is a Computer Science graduate from a top university. During his time in college, he had a few internships with some reputable companies and managed to graduate with a 3.5 GPA. At the end of his college career, Michael [created an online portfolio](/blog/beginners-guide-to-the-programming-portfolio) to showcase his work in hopes of landing a job.\r\n\r\nLet's evaluate the market.\r\n\r\n> Who is Michael's target reader?\r\n\r\nProspective employers and fellow peers in the industry.\r\n\r\n> What are they looking for?\r\n\r\n- Examples showing he is a proficient programmer\r\n- High-quality content they can learn from\r\n- Impressive written communication skills\r\n\r\nMichael decides he wants to start a blog. His goals are to:\r\n\r\n- Effectively research and study new topics\r\n- Practice and exercise different skill sets\r\n- Develop and improve his writing abilities\r\n- Attract viewers that could lead to a job opportunity\r\n\r\nAsk yourself: Are you knowledgeable about something others would find value in reading? If the answer is yes, **start writing now**.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Spongebob`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/spongebob.gif`}\r\n  width={400}\r\n  height={300}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### How Can I Do It?\r\n\r\nOkay, by now I've convinced you this is a good idea. But how do you actually go about _doing_ it?\r\n\r\nI'll start by addressing the most difficult part: **You have to be authentic**. You're creating an online identity for yourself. It needs to be _your_ great ideas and thoughts. You can't write some half-assed article you threw together at 2 AM and didn't proofread. You're trying to build trust with the reader.\r\n\r\nYou need to produce **high-quality content**. You can't write one paragraph and call it good. You have to provide value to your readers. So how do you produce high-quality content?\r\n\r\n1.  Research the subject matter and become very familiar with it. You should be educating your readers.\r\n2.  Tell stories with your articles. Make your readers connect with you.\r\n3.  Use humor when appropriate üòÑ\r\n4.  Include pictures. They're worth 1000 words, remember?\r\n5.  Optimize your article for social media. Read about [meta tags](http://www.wordstream.com/meta-tags) and [open graph](http://ogp.me/).\r\n6.  Don't waste their time - Make your articles concise but still informative.\r\n\r\n### Share Your Content\r\n\r\nAfter you've created some content you're proud of, you should:\r\n\r\n- Proofread it, and then proofread it again.\r\n- Utilize a tool like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to help prevent spelling issues.\r\n- Share it on social media and any other industry-specific communities.\r\n- Send emails to connect with influencers.\r\n- Be active and respond to readers questions and inquiries.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my article.
