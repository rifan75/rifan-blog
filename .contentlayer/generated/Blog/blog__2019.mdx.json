Overall, **I met 90% of my goals**.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n- 💍Got engaged!\r\n- 🏡Bought a townhome with my fiancée\r\n- 🚀Promoted to Software Engineer III\r\n- 📈Gained >100 newsletter subscribers\r\n- 📚Wrote 24 articles which amassed over 150,000 views\r\n- 🎤Spoke in front of >100 people at a conference in Seattle\r\n\r\n## Personal\r\n\r\nHands down, my biggest life event this year was getting engaged to my now fiancée, Allie.\r\nI planned a surprise party so her family and friends could all be there to celebrate the moment. It was unforgettable.\r\n\r\nShortly after, I sold my condo and purchased a new townhome with Allie. This was not a simple process.\r\nPart of the complexity came from listing \"for sale by owner\" instead of with a realtor.\r\nI could write an entire article on the pros & cons of owning vs. renting, but let's just say it was a long three-month process.\r\n\r\nI had the opportunity to travel a lot this year. Denver (x2), Kansas City (x2), Milwaukee, Exuma, and last but not least [Italy](/blog/italy) 🇮🇹\r\nI attended lots of concerts, including my two current favorite bands [LANY](https://thisislany.com) and [The Band CAMINO](https://www.thebandcamino.com/).\r\n\r\n## Professional\r\n\r\nAt the start of 2019, I was finally getting settled into my [new role at Hy-Vee.](/blog/joining-hy-vee)\r\nIt's been a year of **exponential growth** 📈\r\n\r\nWhile I learned a great deal in my 3 years at Workiva, the bulk of the learning came in the first year.\r\nAfter that, there was less exploration of new tools & technologies and more specialized work on our product.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that a good portion of the tech we used was either not widely used across the industry, or only relevant to Workiva.\r\nThis did not translate well when it was time to switch companies.\r\n\r\nLuckily, I've always enjoyed learning and was hungry for a new challenge.\r\nThanks to some great teammates and peers, **I've learned more in 2019** than I did in the prior 3 years.\r\nThis is not an all-encompassing list, but I gained significant experience with the following:\r\n\r\n- [Next.js](/blog/things-ive-learned-building-nextjs-apps)\r\n- [GraphQL](/blog/graphql-at-hy-vee)\r\n- [Apollo Client](/blog/graphql-at-hy-vee)\r\n- [Vercel](/blog/nextjs-firebase-serverless)\r\n- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)\r\n- [React Hooks](/blog/real-time-post-views)\r\n- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)\r\n- [Design Systems](/blog/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems)\r\n- [Component Libraries](/blog/turborepo-design-system-monorepo)\r\n- [CSS-in-JS](/blog/ui-component-library-with-styled-components)\r\n\r\nThis knowledge and experience led to other endeavors.\r\n\r\n- I landed my largest freelance client, **[BeyondHQ](https://beyondhq.co/)**, and built an [entire web application](/blog/nextjs-firebase-serverless) using Next.js, React, Firebase, and styled-components.\r\n- Launched **[Mastering Next.js](https://masteringnextjs.com/)**, a 50+ lesson video course for building applications with Next.js and React.\r\n- Started **[dsmtech.io](https://dsmtech.io/)** to promote tech companies in the DSM area and help engineers find job opportunities (featured in [Innovation Iowa](https://innovationia.com/2019/01/03/dsmtech-io-launches-for-tech-job-seekers-scouting-des-moines/) 🚀).\r\n\r\nThere were a few other notable parts of 2019 worth mentioning.\r\n\r\n- I was promoted to Software Engineer III at Hy-Vee 🎉 I'm leading the design system architecture for our organization of ~150 engineers. New components are built with React, Storybook, and styled-components.\r\n- I've been apart of the [Diversity & Inclusion Committee](https://www.technologyiowa.org/Priorities/ShowPriority?id=4) for the Technology Association of Iowa.\r\n\r\n## Conference Talks\r\n\r\nIn February, I posted an article called [_Technical Recruiting is Broken_](/blog/technical-recruiting-is-broken).\r\nI was frustrated with being incorrectly targeted by recruiters and wanted to share my perspective on what was broken with the process.\r\n\r\nThe response I received was overwhelming.\r\n\r\nOver **10,000 page views** and **200 comments** from engineers sharing their stories about why technical recruiting was broken and their experiences.\r\nOne person who was particularly moved was [Angie Verros](https://www.linkedin.com/in/averros), the organizer behind [Talent42](https://www.talent42.com/home).\r\n\r\n> Talent42 is the national conference focused 100% on helping recruiters hire top technology talent. We bring you keynotes from engineering leaders, tech recruiting leader presentations and panels, hands-on roundtables, and training. Companies like Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Target, Costco, Uber, Disney, Nike, NBC, Etsy, and many search firms send their tech recruiting teams to participate in this practical, how-to conference that’s all about sourcing, interviewing, and closing the best tech talent on earth.\r\n\r\nAngie wanted me to come out to Seattle and speak at Talent42 to share an engineer's perspective on technical recruiting.\r\nCoincidentally, one of my goals for 2019 was to speak at a national conference. _Challenge accepted!_\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Talent42 Recruiting Conference`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/2019/talent42.png`}\r\n  width={1018}\r\n  height={664}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThis talk was one of my favorite moments of the year. I walked on that stage with more confidence than I've ever felt.\r\nIt was an incredible feeling. This inspired me to speak at four other events in 2019.\r\n\r\n## Writing\r\n\r\nI wrote **24 articles** in 2019 and amassed over **150,000 views!** 😱Here are some of my most popular.\r\n\r\n- [Everything I Know About Style Guides, Design Systems, and Component Libraries](/blog/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems)\r\n- [Technical Recruiting is Broken](/blog/technical-recruiting-is-broken)\r\n- [Creating a Monorepo with Lerna & Yarn Workspaces](/blog/turborepo-design-system-monorepo)\r\n- [Things I've Learned Building Next.js Apps](/blog/things-ive-learned-building-nextjs-apps)\r\n\r\n## Looking Ahead To 2020\r\n\r\nI've started outlining some goals for 2020.
