    "raw": "\r\nA few months ago, I posted an article called [Technical Recruiting is Broken](/blog/technical-recruiting-is-broken).\r\nI was frustrated with being incorrectly targeted by recruiters and wanted to share my perspective on what was broken with the process.\r\n\r\nThe response I received was overwhelming.\r\n\r\nOver **10,000 page views** and **200 comments** from engineers sharing their stories about why technical recruiting was broken and their experiences.\r\nOne person who was particularly moved was [Angie Verros](https://www.linkedin.com/in/averros), the organizer behind [Talent42](https://www.talent42.com/home).\r\n\r\n> Talent42 is the national conference focused 100% on helping recruiters hire top technology talent. We bring you keynotes from engineering leaders, tech recruiting leader presentations and panels, hands-on roundtables, and training. Companies like Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Target, Costco, Uber, Disney, Nike, NBC, Etsy, and many search firms send their tech recruiting teams to participate in this practical, how-to conference that‚Äôs all about sourcing, interviewing, and closing the best tech talent on earth.\r\n\r\nAngie wanted me to come out to Seattle and speak at Talent42 to share an engineer's perspective on technical recruiting.\r\n\r\nChallenge accepted üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\r\n\r\n## State of the Union\r\n\r\nAlmost 75% of the 90,000 developers in the latest [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019) are interested in hearing about new opportunities.\r\nClose to 60% of those appear to be switching jobs every 2 years.\r\n\r\n> **75%** are interested in switching jobs and **60%** pull the trigger within **2 years**.\r\n\r\nThere's a variety of reasons for this:\r\n\r\n- Their current company's yearly salary bump isn't cutting it.\r\n- Other companies have more competitive compensation packages.\r\n- They're enticed by the opportunity to work with new, exciting tech.\r\n- Culture change / office politics / etc.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, unemployment rates are low and the tech industry is booming. It‚Äôs an extremely competitive market,\r\n_especially_ in places with a limited talent pool in comparison to the \"tier 1\" tech hubs (SF, Seattle, etc).\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Technical Recruiter`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/how-to-fix-technical-recruiting/iowa-unemployment-rate.png`}\r\n  width={1298}\r\n  height={764}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nWhatever their reason may be, the numbers don't lie.
