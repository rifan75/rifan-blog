I was captivated by its beauty and decided to add visiting Norway and trekking out to visit this abnormal rock structure to my bucket list. Since then, I had been keeping tabs on prices for flights to Oslo, Norway. In March 2017, I noticed that the round trip prices from Chicago to Oslo had significantly dropped due to a special sale. I contacted my friend Andrew asking if he would want to join, knowing he also had the same desire to explore and hike through Norway. Andrew was starting physical therapy school at the end of summer and would soon have limited free time (and a limited budget) so this was the perfect opportunity to take the trip of a lifetime with one of my best friends. We also invited Andrew’s friend JD who I'd not met but had heard great things about. I checked my work schedule and PTO balance and took the plunge - I purchased my plane ticket and committed to the adventure. The three of us were ecstatic and hungry for an unforgettable experience. Throughout the next two months, we planned out our trip determining where to stay, what to visit, and how to most effectively use our time. You'll find my daily travel logs below. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### May 15th, 2017\r\n\r\nI could hardly sleep the night before we departed for Chicago. I kept envisioning what things might look like based on pictures I’d seen and mentally walking through all the places we’d soon visit. That afternoon we left for Chicago and caught a late flight to Stockholm allowing us to sleep throughout the night. As we arrived in Stockholm, we noticed some extremely long lines at customs which were holding all passengers of our connecting flight to Oslo up. Our flight ended up getting delayed a tad to allow everyone to make it through customs in time. Nevertheless, we boarded our small puddle jumper plane for the one-hour flight to Oslo. From the Oslo airport, we took another flight up to Bodø. In the airport, we realized that Andrew had apparently lost his wallet somewhere between airport transfers. After about an hour of searching and contacting the airports, we declared it a loss and moved on – the first bump in the road on this trip. We had about 5 hours to kill until our ferry to the [Lofoten Islands](https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/northern-norway/the-lofoten-islands/), so we ventured out into the city and explored the downtown area as well as the pier. Shortly after, we (attempted) to find the ferry which turned into a long process. We eventually found the ferry boarding room - a small, almost empty building out by the water. There was only one other person inside, which made sense because our ferry was at 12:15 am – not exactly ideal. The next ferry wasn’t until 7 pm the next day, so it was really our only option. As our boarding time finally rolled around, we walked outside to find a massive ferry. The ferry’s main purpose was to transport cars out to the islands and wasn't necessarily intended for passengers. We watched a variety of semis and smaller cars drive up into the bay of the ship. There were only about five total passengers on the ferry. Finally, we embarked on the three and a half hour trip out to Moskenes.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Moskenes Ferry`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/10-days-in-norway/ferry.jpg`}\r\n  width={5421 / 6}\r\n  height={3614 / 6}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### May 16th, 2017\r\n\r\nNorway has two seasonal anomalies that attract tourists: the northern lights which are best seen in the fall, and the midnight sun which we had the good fortune of viewing on our ferry to the islands. Its color palette is hard to describe – an array of yellows, oranges, and purples. In combination with the Arctic sea and the vast mountains, it was a sight we will never forget. 4 am arrived and we docked at Moskenes. We were scheduled to pick up our rental car at 9 am when the business opened. We weren’t entirely sure what we planned to do for the next 5 hours and were all extremely tired. Beside the unloading dock, there was a building that contained restrooms and a waiting room. Extremely tired and unsure what to do, we attempted to sleep in the waiting room until we were able to get our rental car. This “waiting room” wasn’t much bigger than the bathrooms – a small, 6x6 room that had two benches and plain white walls (but at least it had heat). What followed was the most boring five hours of our lives. None of us could sleep, we had no food, and we had no water. Nothing on the island was open and we would have to walk to retrieve anything. We booked our rental car over Facebook Messenger, so we were a little skeptical of how things might pan out. After 9 am had come and gone, we started walking around trying to find someone to talk to about retrieving our car. We found someone who obviously could tell we were waiting for a car and said he would call the owner. About five minutes later, the owner buzzed over and handed us the keys to our car. Immediately, we rushed to the nearest convenience store to get food and water. After downing some basic junk food we felt much better - now we just needed a place to sleep.\r\n\r\nWe couldn’t check into our Airbnb until 3 pm, but had contacted our host and explained our situation. He allowed us to come in early and use the kitchen/living room/shower until the room was ready. We all proceeded to shower and get a much needed fresh change of clothes. At this point, I’m not sure how we weren’t all crashing with as little of sleep as we had. After sitting down and discussing our options for the day, we chose to hike a nearby mountain called [Reinebringen](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1527771-d7262979-Reviews-Reinebringen-Reine_Moskenes_Municipality_Moskenesoy_Lofoten_Islands_Nordland_Nor.html). None of us knew much about it, except that the view from the top was spectacular. Our host gave us directions to the trailhead and we set out to conquer our first mountain of the trip. I’m still not entirely sure how we managed to push through this first hike, running on virtually no energy. It was a three-hour round trip hike with a hefty elevation change. The snow had started to melt so there were some loose rocks and slippery edges that we had to combat. The top portion contained a little bit of standing snow, which luckily we were prepared for with waterproof gear. It was challenging, however, the feeling of hitting the summit and seeing the view made it worth every minute of the struggle.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Reinebringen Hike`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/10-days-in-norway/reinebringen-summit.jpg`}\r\n  width={2000 / 3}\r\n  height={1333 / 3}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nAfter trudging back down the mountain, we were drained. We decided to drive around and search for a local restaurant serving fish. We found one with a daily special of freshly caught halibut along with mashed cauliflower and sweet potatoes. To say this meal revived us would be an understatement, but at a cost. We quickly realized how expensive eating out would be and decided we should probably buy groceries and prepare meals for the rest of the trip (barring a few exceptions). We hopped into our quaint Toyota Camry and buzzed back to our Airbnb, getting some well-needed quality sleep.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### May 17th, 2017\r\n\r\nOur Airbnb was located in a village named Å, at the southernmost point of the Lofoten Islands. It was a house tailored towards backpackers, hosting guests from Airbnb, Booking.com, and other similar websites. There were multiple floors and rooms, and overall it wasn’t too shabby for being located in the middle of nowhere. After showering and eating, we left fairly early in the morning and set out on E10, the single main highway throughout the islands. Like many other roads in Norway, this road was 1 ½ lanes wide but surprisingly well-maintained. Around every bend, there was a new spectacular view of the islands. We had to stop multiple times to take pictures and shoot videos. As lunch time rolled around, we planned to get some groceries and return home to cook our meal. The first grocery store we saw earlier in the morning was closed, which we thought was due to the time. The second one we saw around noon was also closed. And the third. And the fourth. Coincidentally, we also had been commenting about how patriotic Norwegians were with almost every house sporting some size of Norwegian flag. It finally dawned on us that it was Norway’s Independence Day which meant that a lot of stores were closed. We found one that would open in a few hours, so we killed some time in a larger city called Leknes. As we explored the outskirts of the city, we stumbled onto a Viking campground. We drove down to the bottom on a single dirt road to find a Viking ship and various row boats. Eventually, after finally getting groceries and eating a quick snack, we headed back south.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Row Boat`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/10-days-in-norway/row.jpg`}\r\n  width={5472 / 4}\r\n  height={3648 / 4}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nWe stopped at the trailhead for [Kvalvika Beach](http://www.68north.com/outdoors/hiking-kvalvika-beach/) and decided to give the hike a shot. It was a 2km hike which we figured would only take a couple hours. As we reached the beach, we realized that the spot we wanted to be at was an outlook point located higher up on a mountain called Ryten overlooking the beach. Not giving it much thought, we blazed forward up the mountain towards the lookout. This changed things drastically. This hike turned out to be even more difficult than Reinebringen (the previous day) with a more harsh incline. After another hour of hiking, we made it to the summit completely worn out. Somehow the view from the summit managed to top the previous day as well, leaving us in awe. We could see for miles, viewing the surrounding towns as well as all the connecting roads. At 500m up you could imagine it was pretty windy... Regardless, after coming that far and hiking with a 15lb backpack of camera equipment, I had to attempt to fly my drone. I ended up only flying for about a minute but managed to get one shot that made the entire endeavor worth it. Shortly after beginning our descent down, we had the harsh realization that the hike was so difficult because we had strayed from the beaten path. We trekked on, however, and pushed forward towards returning to our car. What we had anticipated being a couple hours turned into five, leaving us extremely famished and dehydrated. As we arrived at the car, we destroyed the single chocolate bar we had purchased giving us enough energy to make it home, eat a warm meal, and get a good night’s rest.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Kalivaki Beach`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/10-days-in-norway/kalivaki.jpg`}\r\n  width={4096 / 4}\r\n  height={2730 / 4}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### May 18th, 2017\r\n\r\nWithout much planned for the following day, we woke up early and decided to get in the car and aimlessly drive. We had become friends with our Airbnb host, Ian, who joined us on our adventure. As we drove through the islands we stopped frequently to take pictures, fly the drone, and soak up the scenery. This took up the better part of the day and before we knew it, we were back home taking a power nap. We wanted to photograph the midnight sun that night, so after our nap, we headed back out to find a good view. As we progressed down the road, we noticed a massive wave of fog rolling in behind the mountain range. We quickly sped over to where it appeared the fog was originating from, only to be stuck behind bridge construction. We had to wait 30 minutes before they were at a stopping point, which was holding up all traffic on the only main road throughout the island. Luckily after the time had passed, the fog was still holding steady and we barreled down the road after it. After finding a place to pull over, I set up my drone and lifted off for the skies. We all huddled around my phone screen as we watched it ascend further and further up through the clouds, eventually breaking through to a movie-like scene. This was hands down the greatest drone flight of my life. Unfortunately, on the way down, my phone just randomly shut off with plenty of battery life left. I wasn’t exactly sure what was happening - if the drone was gone or if I could still control it without the screen. Panicking and fearful that I would lose the amazing footage I had just captured, I quickly descended the drone trying to spot it out of the sky. This was also the first time I’d ever flown my drone to the maximum height (500m) and the furthest distance at the same time (3000m), so I was already a little on edge before I ran into this problem. Thankfully, we did end up seeing it and I landed the drone safely (phew). We packed our gear up and headed back to our Airbnb. It was a successful night. Unfortunately, the night wasn’t over by a long shot.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`DJI Mavic`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/10-days-in-norway/clouds.jpg`}\r\n  width={2394 / 3}\r\n  height={2394 / 3}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nAs we proceeded back to town, we approached the same bridge we had crossed earlier. We had all kind of forgotten about the construction and realized we were going to have to wait until they stopped for a break again before making it home. What we _didn’t_ notice on the way over was the sign (in Norwegian) that said they would only be stopping at 11 pm and 4 am. It was currently 12 am. Our hearts dropped as we realized we were screwed. We attempted pretty much everything to get them to quickly move to the side allowing us to go home, but they refused. We all somewhat attempted to sleep in the car, only to fail miserably and become agitated. Finally, after what seemed like a lifetime, the bridge opened and we drove home defeated.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Midnight Sun`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/10-days-in-norway/fog.jpg`}\r\n  width={2918 / 3}\r\n  height={2216 / 3}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### May 19th, 2017\r\n\r\nOur ferry back to Bodø left at 7 am so there wasn’t much use in sleeping now. We packed our bags, ate some breakfast, and headed to return our car before boarding the ferry. The ferry was calm so we were able to stretch out and finally get some sleep. After arriving in Bodø, we caught a cab to the airport and flew back to Oslo. The next leg of our trip had begun. We picked up a rental car at the airport, opting for a little nicer model – a Volkswagen Gulf with some extra features. We drove into the heart of downtown Oslo and arrived at our modern looking Airbnb, which was just recently renovated. After quickly showering and changing, we set out to explore Oslo with the little daylight we had left. Oslo was extremely clean and decently busy, full of vibrant art and new architecture. We strolled down the pier and grabbed a bite to eat before returning home and falling asleep quickly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### May 20th, 2017\r\n\r\nOur plan for the day was to drive from Oslo to Odda, a six to seven-hour drive across the western countryside of Norway. We departed early and hit the road, initially staying on more populated highways but quickly dispersing into small, windy back roads. This drive had everything you could imagine – snow covered mountain peaks, vast waterfalls, majestic fjords, and mile-long tunnels. Throughout our entire trip, we only saw one cop car. We noticed in the more populated areas they used cameras to regulate the speed, but on the backroads, this was not the case. We took advantage of this as we winded around the sharp, almost single lane corners. Our Airbnb was located just outside Odda, nestled in the countryside smack dab in the middle of a fjord. The small cabin also had a dock down to the water where we got to spend some time relaxing. Our typical night time ritual of getting groceries and preparing a supper commenced. We took the opportunity to relax for the rest of the night, slowing our blistering pace down a notch.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Norway Countryside`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/10-days-in-norway/reflection.jpg`}\r\n  width={5194 / 5}\r\n  height={3463 / 5}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### May 21st, 2017\r\n\r\nRising bright and early, we hit the road for Bergen. It was about a six-hour drive depending on how lost we got and how many times we stopped to take pictures. The drive across Norway continued to extraordinary with more fjords and crystal clear still water. As we arrived in Bergen (Norway's second-largest city) we first stopped at the [Bryggen Wharf](https://en.visitbergen.com/things-to-do/bryggen-in-bergen-p878553). This legendary destination was full of culture and strangely reminded me of Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. We sampled some fresh fish from the market, strolled along the boardwalk, and took in the scenery. I had a shrimp stick, but also tried some fish eggs, monkfish, and scallops. Shortly after, we drove over to the bottom of [Ulriken](http://ulriken643.no/en/), the highest of Bergen’s famous \"Seven Mountains\". There was a cable car that took you 650m up to the summit of the mountain. From the top, you could view the entire city of Bergen in all its glory. I quickly unpacked the drone and got some cinematic shots of the city before we returned down to the ground. Our final stop was to experience the local bar scene, so we stopped into a bar/restaurant by the wharf and grabbed a beer. After (a few) drinks and some quality conversation, we left the pub and headed over to a local bakery. I got a custard filled pastry sprinkled with almonds on top - delicious! With our stomachs full and our thirst quenched, we headed back to Odda to rest and prepare for the Trolltunga hike the next day.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Bergen Cable Car`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/10-days-in-norway/bergen-cable-car.jpg`}\r\n  width={2048 / 3}\r\n  height={1365 / 3}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nBefore returning to our cabin we decided to stop by the trailhead for the hike to make sure we knew where we were going. As we pulled up in front of the trail, we saw a cardboard sign with some black marker scribbled across the front that read \"TRAIL CLOSED DUE TO FLOODING\". Our hearts dropped. One of the main reasons we traveled thousands of miles to another country was now out of commission. For the next thirty minutes, we were all just flustered and not thinking clearly. Finally, we decided to look on Instagram to see if anyone had uploaded any pictures recently. We were attempting to gauge how bad the hike looked in terms of harsh weather, other hikers comments, and what type of gear they were wearing. We saw a mix of good and bad - some people reporting it went smoothly while others suggesting not to attempt the hike and that they had ended up turning around. Luckily, we were prepared with the right gear so we felt comfortable in that department. I was initially hesitant about doing the hike and decided it might be best to sit this one out. The other guys were also skeptical but thought since we'd came this far, we really had no choice but to endure the hike. Eventually, I gave into their way of thinking and decided to go for it.\r\n\r\nHow bad could it be, right?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### May 22nd, 2017\r\n\r\nI can summarize the entirety of this day in one word - intense. The Trolltunga hike is a 22km (14 mile) trek up a mountain range towards the \"troll's tongue\" - a rock formation extended out over the edge of the mountain shaped like a tongue. During this time of the year, the snow is just beginning to melt so approximately 80% of the hike was through thick snow (in some places knee deep). It took us five hours to reach the summit taking multiple stops and a lunch break. I think the view speaks for itself though.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Trolltunga in Odda, Norway`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/10-days-in-norway/trolltunga-summit.jpg`}\r\n  width={2399 / 3}\r\n  height={3000 / 3}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nWe spent about an hour at the top resting and taking in the view. Like usual, I unpacked the drone for a quick flight. It was quite windy at the summit, but it didn't seem unmanageable. I decided to take flight and hope for the best. What I couldn't foresee was the amount of wind further up in the air. My drone started to fly strange before a massive gust of wind swept it away and out of my control. I frantically tried to steer it back in the clear as the other hikers watched my struggle. It ended up crashing down hard into the snow but luckily remained in one piece. To my surprise, everything still worked and nothing was broken - very lucky. That was enough adrenaline for me so we headed back to the start. The hike back took \"only\" three hours since we moved quite a bit faster and even slid down some snowy parts of the mountain (it was perfectly safe, Mom). We were fortunate enough to be equipped with proper waterproof boots and pants, unlike some other hikers we saw. The mountain water was clean and cold, which came in handy as our water supply started to diminish. As we approached the end of the hike, we began to fatigue. While stepping through a difficult area, Andrew slipped and landed on his butt and began to slide down the mountain in front of us. It was quite frightening since we couldn't see what was below him clearly, but luckily he ended up just landing hard on his rear (although giving us quite the scare). In total, it took about nine hours from start to finish. I can honestly say it was one of the hardest things I've ever done. A fitting finale to the trip of a lifetime. I think I've hiked enough for the next five years.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Hiking Trolltunga`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/10-days-in-norway/hiking-trolltunga.jpg`}\r\n  width={4096 / 4}\r\n  height={2730 / 4}\r\n/>\r\n",

We found someone who obviously could tell we were waiting for a car and said he would call the owner. About five minutes later, the owner buzzed over and handed us the keys to our car. Immediately, we rushed to the nearest convenience store to get food and water.

It was a house tailored towards backpackers, hosting guests from Airbnb, Booking.com, and other similar websites. There were multiple floors and rooms, and overall it wasn\\u2019t too shabby for being located in the middle of nowhere. After showering and eating, we left fairly early in the morning and set out on E10, the single main highway throughout the islands. Like many other roads in Norway, this road was 1 \\xBD lanes wide but surprisingly well-maintained. Around every bend, there was a new spectacular view of the islands. We had to stop multiple times to take pictures and shoot videos. As lunch time rolled around, we planned to get some groceries and return home to cook our meal. The first grocery store we saw earlier in the morning was closed, which we thought was due to the time. The second one we saw around noon was also closed. And the third. And the fourth. Coincidentally, we also had been commenting about how patriotic Norwegians were with almost every house sporting some size of Norwegian flag. It finally dawned on us that it was Norway\\u2019s Independence Day which meant that a lot of stores were closed. We found one that would open in a few hours, so we killed some time in a larger city called Leknes. As we explored the outskirts of the city, we stumbled onto a Viking campground. We drove down to the bottom on a single dirt road to find a Viking ship and various row boats.

It was a 2km hike which we figured would only take a couple hours. As we reached the beach, we realized that the spot we wanted to be at was an outlook point located higher up on a mountain called Ryten overlooking the beach. Not giving it much thought, we blazed forward up the mountain towards the lookout. This changed things drastically. This hike turned out to be even more difficult than Reinebringen (the previous day) with a more harsh incline. After another hour of hiking, we made it to the summit completely worn out. Somehow the view from the summit managed to top the previous day as well, leaving us in awe. We could see for miles, viewing the surrounding towns as well as all the connecting roads. At 500m up you could imagine it was pretty windy... Regardless, after coming that far and hiking with a 15lb backpack of camera equipment, I had to attempt to fly my drone. I ended up only flying for about a minute but managed to get one shot that made the entire endeavor worth it. Shortly after beginning our descent down, we had the harsh realization that the hike was so difficult because we had strayed from the beaten path. We trekked on, however, and pushed forward towards returning to our car. What we had anticipated being a couple hours turned into five, leaving us extremely famished and dehydrated.

We had become friends with our Airbnb host, Ian, who joined us on our adventure. As we drove through the islands we stopped frequently to take pictures, fly the drone, and soak up the scenery. This took up the better part of the day and before we knew it, we were back home taking a power nap. We wanted to photograph the midnight sun that night, so after our nap, we headed back out to find a good view. As we progressed down the road, we noticed a massive wave of fog rolling in behind the mountain range. We quickly sped over to where it appeared the fog was originating from, only to be stuck behind bridge construction. We had to wait 30 minutes before they were at a stopping point, which was holding up all traffic on the only main road throughout the island. Luckily after the time had passed, the fog was still holding steady and we barreled down the road after it. After finding a place to pull over, I set up my drone and lifted off for the skies. We all huddled around my phone screen as we watched it ascend further and further up through the clouds, eventually breaking through to a movie-like scene. This was hands down the greatest drone flight of my life. Unfortunately, on the way down, my phone just randomly shut off with plenty of battery life left. I wasn\\u2019t exactly sure what was happening - if the drone was gone or if I could still control it without the screen. Panicking and fearful that I would lose the amazing footage I had just captured, I quickly descended the drone trying to spot it out of the sky. This was also the first time I\\u2019d ever flown my drone to the maximum height (500m) and the furthest distance at the same time (3000m), so I was already a little on edge before I ran into this problem. Thankfully, we did end up seeing it and I landed the drone safely (phew). We packed our gear up and headed back to our Airbnb. It was a successful night.

Our final stop was to experience the local bar scene, so we stopped into a bar/restaurant by the wharf and grabbed a beer. After (a few) drinks and some quality conversation, we left the pub and headed over to a local bakery. I got a custard filled pastry sprinkled with almonds on top - delicious!

I frantically tried to steer it back in the clear as the other hikers watched my struggle. It ended up crashing down hard into the snow but luckily remained in one piece. To my surprise, everything still worked and nothing was broken - very lucky. That was enough adrenaline for me so we headed back to the start.

We were fortunate enough to be equipped with proper waterproof boots and pants, unlike some other hikers we saw. The mountain water was clean and cold, which came in handy as our water supply started to diminish. As we approached the end of the hike, we began to fatigue.

It was quite frightening since we couldn't see what was below him clearly, but luckily he ended up just landing hard on his rear (although giving us quite the scare).

Overall, **I met 90% of my goals**.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n- 💍Got engaged!\r\n- 🏡Bought a townhome with my fiancée\r\n- 🚀Promoted to Software Engineer III\r\n- 📈Gained >100 newsletter subscribers\r\n- 📚Wrote 24 articles which amassed over 150,000 views\r\n- 🎤Spoke in front of >100 people at a conference in Seattle\r\n\r\n## Personal\r\n\r\nHands down, my biggest life event this year was getting engaged to my now fiancée, Allie.\r\nI planned a surprise party so her family and friends could all be there to celebrate the moment. It was unforgettable.\r\n\r\nShortly after, I sold my condo and purchased a new townhome with Allie. This was not a simple process.\r\nPart of the complexity came from listing \"for sale by owner\" instead of with a realtor.\r\nI could write an entire article on the pros & cons of owning vs. renting, but let's just say it was a long three-month process.\r\n\r\nI had the opportunity to travel a lot this year. Denver (x2), Kansas City (x2), Milwaukee, Exuma, and last but not least [Italy](/blog/italy) 🇮🇹\r\nI attended lots of concerts, including my two current favorite bands [LANY](https://thisislany.com) and [The Band CAMINO](https://www.thebandcamino.com/).\r\n\r\n## Professional\r\n\r\nAt the start of 2019, I was finally getting settled into my [new role at Hy-Vee.](/blog/joining-hy-vee)\r\nIt's been a year of **exponential growth** 📈\r\n\r\nWhile I learned a great deal in my 3 years at Workiva, the bulk of the learning came in the first year.\r\nAfter that, there was less exploration of new tools & technologies and more specialized work on our product.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that a good portion of the tech we used was either not widely used across the industry, or only relevant to Workiva.\r\nThis did not translate well when it was time to switch companies.\r\n\r\nLuckily, I've always enjoyed learning and was hungry for a new challenge.\r\nThanks to some great teammates and peers, **I've learned more in 2019** than I did in the prior 3 years.\r\nThis is not an all-encompassing list, but I gained significant experience with the following:\r\n\r\n- [Next.js](/blog/things-ive-learned-building-nextjs-apps)\r\n- [GraphQL](/blog/graphql-at-hy-vee)\r\n- [Apollo Client](/blog/graphql-at-hy-vee)\r\n- [Vercel](/blog/nextjs-firebase-serverless)\r\n- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)\r\n- [React Hooks](/blog/real-time-post-views)\r\n- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)\r\n- [Design Systems](/blog/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems)\r\n- [Component Libraries](/blog/turborepo-design-system-monorepo)\r\n- [CSS-in-JS](/blog/ui-component-library-with-styled-components)\r\n\r\nThis knowledge and experience led to other endeavors.\r\n\r\n- I landed my largest freelance client, **[BeyondHQ](https://beyondhq.co/)**, and built an [entire web application](/blog/nextjs-firebase-serverless) using Next.js, React, Firebase, and styled-components.\r\n- Launched **[Mastering Next.js](https://masteringnextjs.com/)**, a 50+ lesson video course for building applications with Next.js and React.\r\n- Started **[dsmtech.io](https://dsmtech.io/)** to promote tech companies in the DSM area and help engineers find job opportunities (featured in [Innovation Iowa](https://innovationia.com/2019/01/03/dsmtech-io-launches-for-tech-job-seekers-scouting-des-moines/) 🚀).\r\n\r\nThere were a few other notable parts of 2019 worth mentioning.\r\n\r\n- I was promoted to Software Engineer III at Hy-Vee 🎉 I'm leading the design system architecture for our organization of ~150 engineers. New components are built with React, Storybook, and styled-components.\r\n- I've been apart of the [Diversity & Inclusion Committee](https://www.technologyiowa.org/Priorities/ShowPriority?id=4) for the Technology Association of Iowa.\r\n\r\n## Conference Talks\r\n\r\nIn February, I posted an article called [_Technical Recruiting is Broken_](/blog/technical-recruiting-is-broken).\r\nI was frustrated with being incorrectly targeted by recruiters and wanted to share my perspective on what was broken with the process.\r\n\r\nThe response I received was overwhelming.\r\n\r\nOver **10,000 page views** and **200 comments** from engineers sharing their stories about why technical recruiting was broken and their experiences.\r\nOne person who was particularly moved was [Angie Verros](https://www.linkedin.com/in/averros), the organizer behind [Talent42](https://www.talent42.com/home).\r\n\r\n> Talent42 is the national conference focused 100% on helping recruiters hire top technology talent. We bring you keynotes from engineering leaders, tech recruiting leader presentations and panels, hands-on roundtables, and training. Companies like Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Target, Costco, Uber, Disney, Nike, NBC, Etsy, and many search firms send their tech recruiting teams to participate in this practical, how-to conference that’s all about sourcing, interviewing, and closing the best tech talent on earth.\r\n\r\nAngie wanted me to come out to Seattle and speak at Talent42 to share an engineer's perspective on technical recruiting.\r\nCoincidentally, one of my goals for 2019 was to speak at a national conference. _Challenge accepted!_\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Talent42 Recruiting Conference`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/2019/talent42.png`}\r\n  width={1018}\r\n  height={664}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThis talk was one of my favorite moments of the year. I walked on that stage with more confidence than I've ever felt.\r\nIt was an incredible feeling. This inspired me to speak at four other events in 2019.\r\n\r\n## Writing\r\n\r\nI wrote **24 articles** in 2019 and amassed over **150,000 views!** 😱Here are some of my most popular.\r\n\r\n- [Everything I Know About Style Guides, Design Systems, and Component Libraries](/blog/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems)\r\n- [Technical Recruiting is Broken](/blog/technical-recruiting-is-broken)\r\n- [Creating a Monorepo with Lerna & Yarn Workspaces](/blog/turborepo-design-system-monorepo)\r\n- [Things I've Learned Building Next.js Apps](/blog/things-ive-learned-building-nextjs-apps)\r\n\r\n## Looking Ahead To 2020\r\n\r\nI've started outlining some goals for 2020.

      "raw": "\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Facebook`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/analyzing-10-years-of-facebook-data/banner.png`}\r\n  width={1200}\r\n  height={630}\r\n  priority\r\n/>\r\n\r\nI joined Facebook in May 2007. Over the past 10+ years, my activity has ranged from being heavily involved to barely using it for over a year. In the wake of the [#DeleteFacebook](https://twitter.com/hashtag/deletefacebook) uproar, I started to think about my social media footprint. I’m not naive to the amount of data Facebook and other social media platforms have on me, but it’s easy to forget things you said 10 years ago.\r\n\r\nFacebook has an option to export a data dump of “everything” they have stored for your profile. I decided to download this and see what juicy details I could find. As it turns out, there wasn’t a lot of juicy information - just some really old, embarrassing stuff and a few trips down memory lane. I thought I’d summarize some interesting numbers and elaborate on some of the more unexpected finds.\r\n\r\n### Overview 📝\r\n\r\nMy data dump was surprisingly only **500mb**. All of the pictures and videos were heavily compressed, so if you were wanting to keep higher quality copies of these, I’d recommend downloading them separately. In total, I had:\r\n\r\n- 292 photos\r\n- 245 videos\r\n- 5,917 posts & comments\r\n- 43,511 songs streamed\r\n\r\nThe main file, `timeline.html`, is a massive clobber of information. Individual entries are generally structured like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"meta\">Friday, March 9, 2018 at 11:53pm UTC+11</div>\r\n<div class=\"comment\">Some post, comment, song, or link shared</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was able to parse through the contents of this file to create a chart of my facebook activity over time.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Timeline Activity`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/analyzing-10-years-of-facebook-data/activity.png`}\r\n  width={1296}\r\n  height={872}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n**Note:** The full source code to retrieve this information for your own data export will be linked at the bottom of this post.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice my activity picks up a lot after 2012 - I'm guessing most of this is from starting my Spotify premium subscription. For a while, I had my Facebook account linked with Spotify to show what I was currently listening to.\r\n\r\n### Photos 📸\r\n\r\nInside of the `/photos` folder, you'll find a folder for each photo album, as well as an accompanying HTML file to visualize the photos. There's also metadata in the HTML file about what kind of camera was used to take the photo, as well at latitude & longitude information if available. If you wanted, you could probably build a photo map from this.\r\n\r\nI wanted to know four main statistics:\r\n\r\n- Total number of photos\r\n- Total number of comments\r\n- Average comments per photo\r\n- Top 10 commenters\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, I was able to recursively walk through the directory and sum the total number of pictures per photo album. To analyze the comments, I needed to look at the HTML file. Here's an example of the comment structure:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"comment\">\r\n  <span class=\"user\">Probably My Mom</span>Love this photo! ✈️ 🙌🏻 📷\r\n  <div class=\"meta\">Wednesday, May 17, 2017 at 7:08am UTC+10</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom here, I was able to build a map of the top commenters to determine the necessary statistics. Here's what the output looks like:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nNumber of Photos: 292\r\nNumber of Comments: 90\r\nAverage Comments Per Photo: 0.31\r\nTop 10 Commenters:\r\n - My Mom: 17\r\n - Another Person: 15\r\n..\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Videos 📹\r\n\r\nI used a similar approach to parse the `/videos` folder to find the total number of videos.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nNumber of Videos: 175\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did end up finding something interesting with this one. Back in the day when posting on other's walls was a thing, I would occasionally record a song and send it to my friends. What I didn't realize is that Facebook was saving _every attempt I made_ to record the song. This was somewhat disheartening to re-watch as I failed to play a song over and over. I think I audibly said \"Okay, 100th take\" a couple of times. Turns out, [others have noticed this as well.](http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/03/facebook-secretly-saved-videos-users-deleted.html) Here's the thumbnails from a series of failed attempts. Not great.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Facebook Video Thumbnails`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/analyzing-10-years-of-facebook-data/videos.png`}\r\n  width={1100}\r\n  height={676}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Friends List 🙋🏼‍♂️\r\n\r\nInside of the `friends.html` file, you can find the exact dates you added or removed someone as a friend. **Note:** it doesn’t look like people you’ve blocked or have been blocked by are showing up here. I parsed this file to aggregate the number of friends added per year.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Timeline Activity`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/analyzing-10-years-of-facebook-data/friends-added.png`}\r\n  width={1302}\r\n  height={876}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThe data dump also shows everyone you've been in a relationship with on Facebook. It was pretty obvious to spot where things might have started and ended based on the dates you added or removed friends 👀\r\n\r\n### The Script 🎉\r\n\r\nThe structure of the data export appears to be consistent, so I made a Python script to parse and aggregate the statistics mentioned in this post using [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4) to traverse the DOM of the HTML files. To use this script on your own Facebook data dump, first [export your data](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467) and then go to my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/leerob/facebook-data-analyzer) and download the `facebook.py` file. From there, you should place this file in the same folder as your Facebook data dump. To run the script, open the terminal and enter:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pip install bs4 lxml\r\n$ python facebook.py\r\n..\r\n..\r\nNumber of Videos: 175\r\nNumber of Photos: 292\r\nNumber of Comments: 90\r\n..\r\n..\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to install those packages globally, you can use a virtual environment. I purposely made this only work locally so you wouldn't have to upload your exported information anywhere (that's kind of against the point, right?). Hopefully it works well for you - let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion 👏🏼\r\n\r\nIf you feel like taking the script further, here are some other ideas:\r\n\r\n- Find the total number of people you’ve messaged\r\n- Create a chart of who you've messaged the most\r\n- Find the total number of events you've attended\r\n- Analyze the tone of all posts to determine mood (positive / negative)\r\n- Find your top friends based on the number of timeline interactions\r\n\r\nIf you now feel like deleting all your Facebook posts/comments, I found a [Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/social-book-post-manager/ljfidlkcmdmmibngdfikhffffdmphjae?hl=en-US) that should help.\r\nThanks for reading!\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\nChoosing a service to store data can be confusing and overwhelming for a front-end developer.\r\nWhat are all these acronyms? Are the Amazon services named strange on purpose? These and many other questions\r\nawait your journey into the back-end.\r\n\r\nAs a front-end developer turned full-stack, I've spent more time than I'd like to admit trying to figure out the backend.\r\nBecause the backend is harder to _visualize_, I struggled to understand how the pieces fit together. Luckily, I soon found\r\nout I wasn't alone. There's a support group when confused front-end engineers meet called Twitter.\r\n\r\nConsider this article a \"choose your own adventure\" piece. I'll ask questions about your requirements\r\nand then present a few options. Before we can begin our journey, I must first explain the basics. You can\r\nalso jump to the [list of services](/blog/backend#list-of-services) directly.\r\n\r\n## Table of Contents\r\n\r\n- [Backend Basics](/blog/backend#backend-basics)\r\n- [Do You Even Need a Database?](/blog/backend#do-you-even-need-a-database)\r\n- [Low Code Solutions](/blog/backend#low-code-solutions)\r\n- [Terms To Understand](/blog/backend#terms-to-understand)\r\n  - [SQL / NoSQL](/blog/backend#sql--nosql)\r\n  - [GraphQL / REST](/blog/backend#graphql--rest)\r\n  - [Authentication / Authorization](/blog/backend#authentication--authorization)\r\n  - [Hosted / Self-Hosted](/blog/backend#hosted--self-hosted)\r\n  - [Serverless](/blog/backend#serverless)\r\n  - [Data Modeling](/blog/backend#data-modeling)\r\n- [Levels of Abstraction](/blog/backend#levels-of-abstraction)\r\n- [List of Services](/blog/backend#list-of-services)\r\n  - [Backend (as a Service)](/blog/backend#backend-as-a-service)\r\n    - [Supabase](/blog/backend#supabase)\r\n    - [Hasura](/blog/backend#hasura)\r\n  - [Build Your Own Backend](/blog/backend#build-your-own-backend)\r\n    - [Prisma](/blog/backend#prisma)\r\n- [Should You Use a CMS?](/blog/backend#should-you-use-a-cms)\r\n- [Starting From Scratch](/blog/backend#starting-from-scratch)\r\n- [Conclusion / Resources](/blog/backend#conclusion--resources)\r\n\r\n## Backend Basics\r\n\r\nWhat is this scary place, **the back-end?** You can boil it down to this:\r\n\r\n- You need a place to store data ([database](https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/what-are-databases))\r\n- You need a method of retrieving the data ([API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface))\r\n\r\nAs a front-end engineer, you've probably worked with APIs before. They allow you to fetch data from some database, somewhere.\r\nOn a long enough timeline, you'll eventually need to build your own API or\r\nwork with an existing codebase that has a back-end. This brings us to our first question.\r\n\r\n## Do You Even Need a Database?\r\n\r\nYou need a place to store data, right? Here are some questions to consider:\r\n\r\n- Can the data live alongside the code?\r\n- Can the data be tracked with source control?\r\n- Do non-technical people need to modify the data?\r\n- Do you need different levels of access?\r\n\r\nIf you can store your data with your code in [source control](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/source-control),\r\nyou might be fine using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)\r\nwith [git](https://git-scm.com/) – that's what [this blog](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) uses.\r\nIt's also worth mentioning you _could_ use JSON files as a pseudo-database if you fall into this category.\r\n\r\nHowever, you're likely reading this article because **you need a database**. Before we start learning about how you can create\r\nyour own backend, you might also consider a low-code solution.\r\n\r\n## Low Code Solutions\r\n\r\nSince you're a front-end developer, you might be able to utilize a low code solution.\r\nThese low code tools are arguably the fastest way to get access to some remote data.\r\n\r\nCommon examples include [Google Sheets](https://github.com/franciscop/use-spreadsheet) or [Airtable](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-airtable/)\r\nas a database. There are other services that provide an [API abstraction](https://nocodeapi.com/) on a variety of data sources.\r\n\r\n<ProsCard\r\n  title=\"low code\"\r\n  pros={[\r\n    'You are very familiar with spreadsheets',\r\n    'You only have a basic understanding of web development',\r\n    'You want the quickest solution possible',\r\n    'You need to collaborate with many people on data entry'\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<ConsCard\r\n  title=\"low code\"\r\n  cons={[\r\n    'Higher probability of needing to change services at scale',\r\n    'Some low code tools require paid plans'\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Terms To Understand\r\n\r\nOkay, so you need a database and it's going to require code.\r\nFirst, I need to explain some terms you'll likely run into.\r\n\r\n### SQL / NoSQL\r\n\r\nA SQL database contains [relational data](https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/comparing-database-types#relational-databases-working-with-tables-as-a-standard-solution-to-organize-well-structured-dataauthentication). Consider a social media site with a table for `users` and `posts`.\r\nEvery user represents a row in the `users` table.\r\nEach user can have many different `posts`. There is a **relation** between a post and the user.\r\nThese relations makes it easy to look up different pieces of data through queries.\r\n\r\nNoSQL databases are (generally) document-oriented. Unlike a SQL database, there are no tables or rows.\r\nInstead, you store data in documents, which get organized into collections.\r\nFor example, in [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model) each document contains a set of key-value pairs.\r\nThis is a great option for large collections of small documents.\r\n\r\n### GraphQL / REST\r\n\r\nAPIs allow programs to talk to each other. [REST](https://restfulapi.net/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) are simply two different ways to fetch data. For example, here's a\r\n`GET` request to fetch the number of views for a blog post.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl https://leerob.io/api/page-views?id=databases\r\n\r\n{ \"total\": 1234 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nGraphQL is an open-source [specification](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/) for how to query your APIs.\r\nConverting the previous example from REST to a GraphQL query might look like this.\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\n{\r\n  post(id: \"databases\") {\r\n    views\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more, [here's an excellent resource](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/intro-graphql/graphql-vs-rest/).\r\n\r\n### Authentication / Authorization\r\n\r\n[Authentication](https://dataguide.prisma.io/postgresql/authentication-and-authorization/intro-to-authn-and-authz#what-are-authentication-and-authorization) verifies who a user is, while [authorization](https://dataguide.prisma.io/postgresql/authentication-and-authorization/intro-to-authn-and-authz#what-are-authentication-and-authorization) verifies what they have access to.\r\nYou'll commonly see this abbreviated as AuthN (Authentication) and AuthZ (Authorization).\r\n\r\nIf you're building any application that has users or requires limiting access to certain areas, you'll need to consider both of these.\r\n\r\n### Hosted / Self-Hosted\r\n\r\nYour database can either be hosted (managed by someone else) or self-hosted.\r\nWhen backend services are open-source, it generally means there is an option to self-host.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to deal with infrastructure, use a hosted service.\r\n\r\n### Serverless\r\n\r\nServerless allows you to write and deploy code without the hassle of worrying about the underlying infrastructure.\r\nYou only pay when your code runs. With a traditional server, it's always running.\r\nIn general, serverless should have less maintenance. There are, however, [tradeoffs](https://www.serverless.com/blog/when-why-not-use-serverless).\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning how you deploy your front-end might impact which back-end service you choose.\r\nFor example, if you use [Next.js](/blog/learn-nextjs) and server-side rendering, each page generates a [serverless function](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/what-is-a-serverless-function/).\r\nAt a large enough scale, you'll run into issues where there are too many open connections to your database. A common solution\r\nfor this is connection pooling. For more information, check out [Prisma's deployment documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/deployment).\r\n\r\n### Data Modeling\r\n\r\nWhen learning about databases, you might hear terms like [one-to-many](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-many_(data_model)>)\r\nand [many-to-many](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-to-many_(data_model)>). These are ways of modeling your database relationships.\r\n[Database normalization](https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/intro-to-schemas) is\r\nhow you organize a database into tables and columns.\r\n\r\n## Levels of Abstraction\r\n\r\nEvery situation is unique. There are _many_ tools that exist to solve the same problem. By understanding what you're looking for,\r\nit will help you choose the right solution. First, let's understand _what_ you're trying to build.\r\n\r\n- Are you building this backend for yourself?\r\n- Will other people need to use it / support it?\r\n- Are you trying to build a [Minimum Viable Product (MVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)?\r\n\r\nPersonally, I like to experiment with new technologies when I'm creating personal projects. If I'm\r\npicking a tool for my day job, I'll likely default to one that's well-adopted in the industry and has\r\nrobust support. There's more control picking a backend when you're a solo-founder building the entire\r\ntech stack yourself. As you introduce other engineers into the mix, things get more complicated.\r\n\r\nIf you need something fast, you'll want a higher-level abstraction. These services typically provide a client or API\r\nout of the box that reduces the amount of boilerplate code you need to write. This is commonly referred to as\r\nautomating the [CRUD (Create, read, update and delete)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) portion of your backend.\r\n\r\nLet's assume you want something more high-level, ideally with a website or interface to manage your data.\r\nIf you want complete control, you might consider [building your own](/blog/backend#build-your-own-backend).\r\n\r\n## List of Services\r\n\r\nI've crowdsourced a list of services you might consider using. Below, I'll give further insights into a few services I know well.\r\nThe reality is that each service listed here has its own tradeoffs. Hopefully this gives you a high-level overview to research more.\r\nIt's also worth mentioning the service you already know well might be your best choice.\r\nHere's some questions to consider.\r\n\r\n- Does your backend need to be built on open-source technology?\r\n- What level of vendor lock-in are you comfortable with?\r\n- Are there are security considerations your company/client has?\r\n- How much do you want to build yourself vs. rely on a service?\r\n- Do you need social login? (Sign in with Google, Facebook, etc.)\r\n- Do you have an existing database you're trying to improve access to?\r\n\r\n### Backend (as a Service)\r\n\r\nThese are (typically) managed services that automate the creation of code based on your [database schema](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BZz8R7mqu0).\r\nYou might see these referred to as \"in a box\" solutions. For example, Hasura provides a GraphQL API in a box as part of the platform.\r\n\r\n- ✅ &nbsp;Yes, or included directly in the platform\r\n- ⛔️ &nbsp;Not supported or available\r\n- 🚧 &nbsp;Requires some work\r\n\r\n| Name                                           | Type     | Open Source | Self Hosted Option | AuthN Included | GraphQL |\r\n| ---------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ------- |\r\n| [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)       | NoSQL    | ⛔️         | ⛔️                | ✅             | ⛔️     |\r\n| [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)            | NoSQL    | ✅          | ✅                 | ✅             | ⛔️     |\r\n| [Fauna](https://fauna.com/)                    | NoSQL    | ⛔️         | ⛔️                | ✅             | ✅      |\r\n| [Userbase](https://userbase.com/)              | NoSQL    | ✅          | ✅                 | ✅             | ⛔️     |\r\n| [PlanetScale](https://www.planetscale.com/)    | SQL      | ✅          | ⛔️                | 🚧             | ⛔️     |\r\n| [Hasura](https://hasura.io/)                   | Postgres | ✅          | ✅                 | 🚧             | ✅      |\r\n| [Nhost](https://nhost.io/)                     | Postgres | ✅          | ✅                 | ✅             | ✅      |\r\n| [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)               | Postgres | ✅          | ✅                 | ✅             | ✅      |\r\n| [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) | Both     | ✅          | ✅                 | ✅             | ✅      |\r\n\r\n### Supabase\r\n\r\nSupabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase. But it's really much more than that. If you want Postgres, you'll want Supabase, hands down. They also have [authentication](https://supabase.com/auth), [storage](https://supabase.com/storage), and support for [GraphQL](https://supabase.com/blog/2021/12/03/pg-graphql).\r\n\r\n<ProsCard\r\n  title=\"Supabase\"\r\n  pros={[\r\n    'You need to launch an application quick',\r\n    'You want authentication included',\r\n    'You need to support social logins',\r\n    'You need real-time data',\r\n    'You want to use Postgres'\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<ConsCard\r\n  title=\"Supabase\"\r\n  cons={[\r\n    'You want to use MySQL instead of Postgres',\r\n    `You don't want to bet on an earlier stage company`\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Hasura\r\n\r\nHasura allows you to create an instant GraphQL API based on Postgres. With [Hasura Cloud](https://hasura.io/cloud/), it's easy\r\nto go from an idea to a live API. I love that you can create your database models directly through their console.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't looked at Hasura since they've launched their managed service, give it another look. One of the\r\nissues I had before Hasura Cloud was [cold starts](https://medium.com/faun/on-the-serverless-cold-start-problem-2fc0797da5cc) with the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) free tier. Hasura Cloud prevents this while remaining\r\non the free tier.\r\n\r\nWhile Hasura generally recommends using Auth0 for authorization, it's possible to [roll your own](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/auth/index.html).\r\nIf you want authentication included with Hasura, consider [Nhost](https://nhost.io/).\r\n\r\n<ProsCard\r\n  title=\"Hasura\"\r\n  pros={[\r\n    'You need to launch an application quick',\r\n    'You want to use GraphQL',\r\n    'You need an easy watch to extend an existing service (Remote Schema)',\r\n    `You don't already have a database`\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<ConsCard\r\n  title=\"Hasura\"\r\n  cons={[\r\n    `You'll need lots of custom backend logic`,\r\n    'You want authentication included zero-config'\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Build Your Own Backend\r\n\r\nThese are libraries and tools to build your own API and back-end logic. In general, I wouldn't recommend these\r\nfor absolute beginners. Personally, I learn best by _doing_. My entry into back-end development came through\r\nbuilding real applications and trying out different technologies. You want some quick wins at the start so you can\r\nfeel like you're progressing.\r\n\r\nWhen you lose a level of abstraction, there are other pieces you need to consider.\r\n\r\n- How distributed is my userbase?\r\n- How reliable does my database / backend need to be?\r\n- What kind of tooling does the solution provide (for example, [database migrations](https://www.alooma.com/blog/what-is-database-migration))\r\n\r\nIt's also worth mentioning you can use [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) to self-host any SQL-based database.\r\nIt's [proven technology](http://boringtechnology.club/) that even has [credits available](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/02/aws-launches-activate-founders-package/)\r\nfor founder/startups.\r\n\r\n| Name                                                                | Type      | Open Source | Self Hosting? | AuthN Included | GraphQL |\r\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------- |\r\n| [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)                    | NoSQL     | ✅          | ✅            | ⛔️            | ⛔️     |\r\n| [Prisma](https://prisma.io)                                         | SQL-based | ✅          | ✅            | ⛔️            | ⛔️     |\r\n| [Prisma](https://prisma.io) + [Nexus](https://nexus.js.org/)        | SQL-based | ✅          | ✅            | 🚧             | ✅      |\r\n| [Prisma](https://prisma.io) + [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) | SQL-based | ✅          | ✅            | ✅             | ⛔️     |\r\n\r\n_Honorable Mentions: Laravel, Rails. I wanted to keep this JavaScript focused._\r\n\r\n### Prisma\r\n\r\nPrisma provides an auto-generated and type-safe query builder based on your database schema. It currently supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite and MongoDB.\r\n\r\nIf you want to build a GraphQL API with Prisma, you can pair it with [Nexus](https://nexus.js.org/). Nexus has [plug-ins](https://nexus.js.org/docs/api-plugins)\r\nfor authentication / authorization.\r\n\r\n<ProsCard\r\n  title=\"Prisma\"\r\n  pros={[\r\n    'You have an existing database',\r\n    'You want to use TypeScript',\r\n    'You have highly relational data',\r\n    'You want the freedom of choosing any SQL-based solution'\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<ConsCard\r\n  title=\"Prisma\"\r\n  cons={[\r\n    `You want a solution that provides the API for you`,\r\n    `You don't want to worry about self-hosting`\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Should You Use a CMS?\r\n\r\nA [Content Management System (CMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)\r\nallows you to manage the creation and modification of your data, which typically includes a database.\r\nFor example, [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) might use a MySQL database to store the content.\r\nShould you use a CMS or just use a database directly? More questions.\r\n\r\n- Are you dealing with images or document storage?\r\n- Do any non-technical users need to manage the data?\r\n- Do you need to [localize](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n) the data?\r\n- Do you need drafts / previews of content (like blog posts)?\r\n\r\nIf you answered yes to any of those questions, you might want to [explore a CMS](https://bejamas.io/blog/headless-cms/).\r\n\r\n## Starting From Scratch\r\n\r\nSome (usually more experienced) full-stack developers end up wanting full control over their infrastructure and prefer to work directly with databases.\r\nThis typically requires a more fundamental understanding of the back-end. There's entire books on this subject, which include the following list of buzzwords.\r\n\r\n- [Object-relational mappers (ORMs)](https://dataguide.prisma.io/types/relational/comparing-sql-query-builders-and-orms#what-are-orms)\r\n- [Manually sharing / replicating](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)>)\r\n- [Scaling instances](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/scaling-your-amazon-rds-instance-vertically-and-horizontally/)\r\n- [Provisioning servers](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-provisioning)\r\n- [Transactions](https://documentation.progress.com/output/ua/OpenEdge_latest/aswsp/what-is-a-database-transaction-3f.html) / [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)\r\n- [Containers](https://www.docker.com/why-docker)\r\n\r\nDon't feel overwhelmed. As front-end developers, we know that we don't need to know _everything_. Both the front-end and back-end are complex, dense areas.\r\nStart small, learn intently, and soon you will be crafting your own APIs with ease.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion / Resources\r\n\r\nWould you change anything? Do you have any resources for learning the back-end? If so, leave a comment below and I'll update this list.\r\n\r\n- [How to Become a Good Backend Engineer (Fundamentals)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3ZPPPKEipA)\r\n- [What are web servers and how do they work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhpUch6lWMw)\r\n- [Best GraphQL Stack for Node.js](https://www.benawad.com/what-is-the-best-graphql-stack-for-nodejs/)\r\n- [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/)\r\n",

    "body": {
      "raw": "\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Programming Portfolio`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/beginners-guide-to-the-programming-portfolio/banner.png`}\r\n  width={1732}\r\n  height={456}\r\n  priority\r\n/>\r\n\r\nI recently decided it was time to invest in my portfolio. I’ve had a portfolio for some time, but hadn’t really stepped back and researched how I could maximize it’s effectiveness. I spent weeks pouring over portfolios online and researching the best material to include on my site. What you’ll find in this post is a summary of everything I’ve researched and created to help you publish a stunning programming portfolio of your own.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I was working to improve my own portfolio, I had the opportunity to spend time interviewing candidates for an open position at my workplace. We were in the process of hiring a new intern on my team who I’d be working directly with frequently. Obviously, I wanted to hire the best candidate and someone who I’d enjoy working with. As I dove into the pile of hundreds of resumes, I found that maybe 20% of the candidates had a portfolio link included and only a handful of the portfolios were well done. This was extremely surprising to me, and is part of the reason I was motivated to write this blog post.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t matter what stage of employment you’re in. You might still be in school, recently graduated, or looking to make a career shift. I can tell you with confidence, the best time to invest in yourself is now. You never know when your dream job will be available, and you’ll want to have your online footprint established when that time comes.\r\n\r\n## Why Do You Need A Portfolio?\r\n\r\nOne of my main takeaways from researching the programming portfolio was the resistance of creating one. A lot of programmers feel it’s unnecessary, extra work they don’t need to do. What they’re missing (and what becomes your opportunity) is the most important thing. You have the chance to **stand out**. Let’s use this example.\r\n\r\nAs of their 2015 filing with the SEC, there were [over 23,000 employees in R&D](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm) at Google. One source states that on average, Google hires [1 employee out of every 130 applicants](https://www.smartrecruiters.com/blog/google-averages-130-applicants-to-make-one-hire/), or about 0.7%. In his book titled _Work Rules_, Google’s SVP (Senior Vice President) of People Operations (basically Human Resources) states:\r\n\r\n> “We receive more than two million applications every year. [...] Of these, Google hires only several thousand per year, making Google twenty-five times more selective than Harvard, Yale, or Princeton.”\r\n\r\nBased on that example, the acceptance rate is even lower - around 0.2 - 0.3%. This just reinstates the fact you need to stand out as much as possible. Taking initiative tends to be a trait employers appreciate in their employees, and creating a portfolio and distinguishing yourself from your peers is a step in the right direction. Creating a portfolio allows you to achieve a variety of things that don’t translate to the typical resume:\r\n\r\n- **Show your code off!** If you’re trying to achieve a sought after job, you probably have spent some time creating projects to learn how to code. Whether that was for fun or for school work, hopefully you have a few examples of your coding ability in existence.\r\n- **Express your personality.** Your life and body of work is more than just a piece of paper. For a hiring manager to really get a good feel for you, they want to know the most fundamental question: would I enjoy working with this person? Your personality doesn’t always shine through your resume and ideally you want it to be an asset that gets you an interview. Your portfolio can help the employer get a better idea of how well you’ll fit in at their company, which also helps ensure you don’t take a job you’re not a good fit for.\r\n- **Improve your online footprint.** A lot of employers judge your initial application based on the quality of your online footprint. Essentially, this just means what they find when they Google your name. They want to see relevant information about you. They don’t want to find your old MySpace profile filled with pictures of your cat. Regularly checking and working to improve your online footprint is a critical requirement for the software industry. Having a portfolio helps to ensure your best content is shown first.\r\n\r\nThe positive effects of a portfolio aren’t a newfound discovery, either. In her 2012 article in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/jobs/an-online-portfolio-can-showcase-your-work-career-couch.html), Eilene Zimmerman states:\r\n\r\n> “One of the first things a recruiter or hiring manager does after receiving a promising lead is to search for the person on Google. Creating your own Web site or displaying your work on a larger platform gives you some control over what is found.”\r\n\r\nEven software industry leaders are noticing a trend towards displaying your work online. One popular source is [GitHub](https://www.github.com), which allows applicants to display their projects and their contributions to open source software. John Resig, the creator of [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), a popular Javascript library, said:\r\n\r\n> “When it comes to hiring, I'll take a GitHub commit log over a resume any day.”\r\n\r\nResig’s main point is that he values actual real world examples of a candidate's work rather than what they claim to do on paper. This is why popular sites such as [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) now allow you to link your GitHub profile on its careers page for applicants. Jeff Atwood, the co-founder of Stack Exchange (Stack Overflow’s parent company) even said this:\r\n\r\n> “Just seeing what kind of work people have done, and what sort of online artifacts they've created, is tremendously helpful in getting a sense of what people do and what they're good (or bad) at.”\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is this: Hiring managers want tangible work. They want reassurance that you understand how to code and are a decent human being before they allocate the time and resources necessary to interview you. Your portfolio provides a platform for you to sell yourself to potential employers, including your most relevant and impressive work.\r\n\r\n## Planning Your Portfolio & Researching the Competition\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Computer Desk`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/beginners-guide-to-the-programming-portfolio/desk.jpg`}\r\n  width={1915}\r\n  height={1294}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nBefore we can begin effectively planning our portfolio, we need to first understand where we currently sit. Let’s research and evaluate our own online footprint. This starts with a simple Google search of your name. Now, depending on how unique your name is, this could be very simple. Your relevant social media profiles might show up, some accounts you’ve used before with similar usernames, or maybe even some new articles or accolades (hopefully good ones). If your name is uncommon however, this might be more of a challenge. Personally, I was not too excited to find out there was a professional football player named Lee Robinson. Luckily, the second result was my Twitter profile. Once you’ve determine where you stand, you can work to cut the fat (deleting old accounts, cleaning up your social media profiles) and start planning for the future. You ideally want your portfolio to be listed on the first page of Google results for your name.\r\n\r\nNow that we know where we stand, let’s do some research on our peers. When I was creating my portfolio, I researched my co-workers and other software engineers in the area to see what I was up against. I even extended this search further to individuals who had the position I was looking for in the future; senior engineers at top tech companies or CEOs of start ups. Getting a feel for your competition will help you determine what you want and (more importantly) what you don't want to include in your portfolio. Use this research to your advantage.\r\n\r\nCombining your research from various Google searches, set up a plan to create your portfolio. You should first ask yourself a few questions:\r\n\r\n- What type of content do I think I’ll host on my portfolio?\r\n- Will this content be primarily text based or picture based?\r\n- Am I interested in blogging? Should that be a main portion of my site?\r\n- Do I want to limit things to a single page?\r\n\r\nThese quick four questions will help you narrow down exactly what your portfolio should include. For example, let’s walk through the questions. The type of content hosted on your portfolio could range from simply just your resume and accomplishments to: a series of blog posts, freelance development work, side hobbies, your social media feeds, pictures and videos, you name it. Understanding what this content is will help you decide on a layout for your site. If it’s primarily text based, you might want to emphasize a crisp, clean font and easy to read headings. If it’s more picture based, you'll want to ensure pictures load fast and are in good quality. You want to maximize the user’s experience while visiting your portfolio. If you think you might start blogging, you could always add that in later. However, if you want blogging to be a main focus of your site, that plays heavily into the layout and design. Let's start to put the pieces together as we look at exactly what to include in your portfolio.\r\n\r\n## What Should You Include?\r\n\r\n- **Your name.** Self-explanatory.\r\n- **Contact information.** Once they’ve decided they want to interview you, they need an avenue to reach you. Give them as many as you're comfortable with. Email would be the most common.\r\n- **Resume.** Your portfolio will allow you to elaborate more on your work experience, education, and project history, but you should still include a downloadable link to your resume in whatever format you choose (I prefer .pdf) for convenience.\r\n- **Your skills.** What programming languages are you proficient in? Which ones do you have experience with? What libraries or frameworks have you used? Are you a master of any certain software? These are all great things to include to show your technical aptitude. Be cautious though: this shouldn’t be a list of every programming language or buzzword you can think of. A lot of employers will treat anything on your resume or portfolio as fair game when it comes to a technical interview. If you’ve only used C++ for one school project, you might not want to include that.\r\n- **Information about yourself.** Use this opportunity to let your personality shine and let the user learn about you. If they’re considering hiring you, they want to be sure they’d enjoy working with you on a daily basis. Include some of your hobbies and what you like to do in your free time. However, don’t just say “I like to code”. I would hope you like to code, and your portfolio should speak for that, but you don’t need to explicitly say it.\r\n- **Social media profiles.** If you professionally use social media, include them. If you don’t have a GitHub account, it’s time to make one.\r\n- **Projects.** This may or may not apply to you. For current students and new grads, this is an opportunity to show you understand how to program even though you might not have a lot of real world experience. This gives the employer tangible examples of your work. Anyone can say they understand a programming language, but a complex project on your GitHub profile goes a lot farther than a simple bullet point.\r\n- **Blog (optional).** Personally, I love portfolios that contain blog posts. Communication is such a major factor in determining whether or not you will get hired. The bottom line is: if you can’t communicate effectively, you probably won’t succeed. Showing your literacy through blog posts helps the employer see you’re an effective written communicator and also shows you’re passionate about something. Your blog posts don’t have to be technical. Write about whatever you enjoy.\r\n\r\n## Choosing A Design\r\n\r\nIt’s finally time to start creating your portfolio! At this time, you should have a rough idea of what you want things to look like. Depending on your proficiency with HTML/CSS/Javascript, you have the option of designing your website from scratch. However, my first approach was by starting off from a template. There’s quite a few advantages of using a template.\r\n\r\n- It’s already responsive, meaning it will work on desktop or mobile.\r\n- Most developers aren’t also designers. Designing is tough.\r\n- It lowers the barrier to entry for beginning web developers.\r\n- Ultimately, it saves you time and makes your life easier.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of sites that offer templates 100% free under the Creative Commons license. Alternatively, you can start from the template below.\r\n\r\n## Hosting, Deploying, and Securing\r\n\r\nLet's deploy your portfolio! We'll be using git. Git allows you to track changes for your files and collaborate with others.\r\nIf you haven’t already, create a GitHub account. It's free and simple to deploy secure sites (and get your own URL) with Vercel.\r\nYou don't have to worry about setting up HTTPS or dealing with DNS records – it's all managed for you.\r\n\r\n1. [Use this template](https://demo.vercel.blog/) (or choose your own git repo) to deploy your portfolio to [Vercel](http://vercel.com/).\r\n1. Additionally, you can purchase a [custom domain](https://vercel.com/docs/custom-domains) and add it to your project.\r\n\r\nHopefully you found this post helpful and are on your way to creating a stunning portfolio!

      "raw": "\r\nI was recently in the job hunt before starting my [new position at Hy-Vee](/blog/joining-hy-vee). During that experience, I learned a lot about what benefits I like and dislike. Through some self-reflection, I've put together a list of benefits I care about. I think this goes without saying, but these are simply my opinions - your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\n## Positives\r\n\r\n1. **Talented co-workers.** Above everything else, I want to be surrounded by smart people who will push me to learn, grow exponentially, and progress in my career.\r\n2. **Flexible hours and remote work.** After a three-month stint [working remotely abroad](/blog/the-search-for-everything), there's no way I could go back to a typical 9-5 desk job. Ideally, I'll work from home at least one day a week. I think 100% remote work is excellent, but not for everyone.\r\n3. **Personal health.** Having a culture with a healthy work-life balance that doesn't promote burnout is critical. A culture focused around personal health that has adequate health coverage as well as some sort of gym package (on-site or stipend).\r\n4. **Autonomy.** Does your manager give you the freedom to make decisions in your area of expertise? Do they trust and value your opinion? Do they go to battle for you? Do they set clear expectations?\r\n5. **Working with industry standards.** Are the main programming languages widely used? Does the company value [open-source software](/blog/why-i-create-open-source-software)? How much internal software is being used? From my experience working with languages that were _not_ industry standard, it can be a nightmare just trying to find a simple answer on Google. If you happen to encounter a bug, you might not have the community support needed to get it patched and released in a timely manner.\r\n6. **Office location and environment.** Transitioning from my last job to my current role, I cut my commute in half saving ~40 minutes a day. That time _really_ adds up and you can put a price to it. Ideally, the office has lots of [natural light](https://hbr.org/2018/09/the-1-office-perk-natural-light) and proper space for everyone (not four people crammed at one desk). I honestly don't mind open office plans that much if you have the flexibility to work remotely.\r\n7. **A culture of open communication.** Are there frequent meetings with your boss (and bosses)? Is the feedback loop short? Are meetings that don't provide value reduced to an email? Are developers given large, open blocks of time to focus on coding? Does executive management seek feedback and continuously improve their processes?\r\n\r\n## Don't Care\r\n\r\nMy list for what I don't care about is much shorter. I'm not too jaded (...yet).\r\n\r\n1. **Game rooms.** I mean, I get it. I see the appeal and why it's pushed as a recruiting tool. But in practice, I've never wanted a ping-pong break in between coding sessions. Some people treat it as \"culture building\" but in my opinion, if you satisfy the above criteria for benefits, then you already have a pretty amazing culture. I'd rather build comradery with my teammates over a great lunch than darts.\r\n2. **Dog-friendly / kid friendly.** Let's be honest - most of the time someone brings their new puppy to work they are distracting everyone. I don't think I really need to elaborate more on a child. I see the benefit, and hey maybe your kid/dog is well behaved and can handle it, but it's not for me.\r\n3. **Beer on tap.** Having a social hour and beer on tap is nice, but I don't mind if it isn't there. I think an occasional company event or team outing suffices.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it comes down to the culture the company wants to promote. If their pitch to me is \"We have beer on tap and a game room!\"... that's going to be a hard pass.

    "summary": "What decisions go into evaluating software solutions?",
    "image": "/static/images/build-vs-buy/banner.png",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\r\nAn essential part of any software company is the tooling required to build, test, deploy, release, and monitor their software. This is an integral part of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Whether you should build or buy this tooling is a critical, expensive decision.\r\n\r\nCan we find an off-the-shelf product that satisfies the needs of our company? What about an open-source solution? Do we need to build something custom? There are many factors that influence this decision. It ultimately depends on the nuances of your company, industry, and product.\r\n\r\nThis article will be a real-world example of why we chose to build our own monitoring and alerting system to support our Software as a Service (SaaS) product. To start, let me first explain the company and give some background.\r\n\r\n### What is Workiva?\r\n\r\n[Workiva (WK)](https://www.workiva.com/) is a cloud-based software company in the finance industry used by over 80% of Fortune 500 companies. Founded in 2008, we now have over 1200 employees and many offices around the world.\r\n\r\nWe want to ship quality code as fast and securely as possible. I joined Workiva in 2015 to work at the end of our DevOps pipeline: monitoring.\r\n\r\n> “DevOps is a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality.”\r\n\r\n### State of Monitoring (2015)\r\n\r\nAn engineer on a product team is given requirements for a task to complete. After making the necessary code changes and testing her work, she opens a pull request (PR) on GitHub to have the changes reviewed by her team.\r\n\r\nStatic analysis (e.g. code linting) and test suites run against her code. If all checks pass and the PR has been properly reviewed, it is merged and the code will make its way to production.\r\n\r\nLet’s say a user encounters an error while using our product. How does the engineer who created the new feature know that things are broken? Ideally, this error would trigger an alert to notify the engineer that there was a problem.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this was not the reality for most engineers at this time. The main source of notification was via a daily email instead of near real-time alerting to a chat room. Theoretically, engineers could query the logs in Splunk at any time to find out if there was a problem. Unfortunately, many engineers found the query language difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nThis meant it sometimes took hours before engineers reacted to an issue if there hadn’t been a complaint from a customer yet. We wanted to improve our support process and ideally fix issues before customers even noticed there was a problem. We wanted every team to be set up with near real-time alerting for the errors they cared about. These alerts needed to be relevant and helpful, decreasing the time it took to analyze and fix issues.\r\n\r\n### Evaluating Options\r\n\r\nOur company, product, and industry presented us with some difficult requirements:\r\n\r\n- Strict security and compliance requirements\r\n- Sensitive customer data\r\n- A wide variety of programming languages (some not well used)\r\n- Massive code base (100s of repositories) would require a lot of changes\r\n\r\nNot a single off-the-shelf solution we found supported every major programming language we used. This wasn’t a complete showstopper, because some had REST APIs or other methods of getting data sent to their product. It just required a bit more work.\r\n\r\nAt the time, very few had SOC compliance or the ability to run on-premise. This was a deal breaker for a lot of the options we considered since the security of our customer’s data is paramount.\r\n\r\nWe evaluated the time it would take to adopt the final two contending solutions to match our infrastructure and processes. Did they have all the features we wanted? How much of our codebase would we need to modify to make their product work? Would we be guaranteed support from the company in case we encountered bugs or intricacies with their system? Would we be able to create integrations for company-specific needs?\r\n\r\n### Our Decision\r\n\r\nAfter weighing the options and much debate, we decided it was in our best interest to build our own solution, utilizing existing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google App Engine (GAE) which allow you to only pay for what you need. Our main goals behind this decision were to:\r\n\r\n- Provide value faster by incrementally building a new solution versus adapting to existing solutions\r\n- Create a scalable, reliable platform that will revolutionize the support process of our products\r\n- Drive the adoption of this solution by desire and not requirement so that 100% of production services have near real-time alerting set up\r\n\r\nThat’s where my journey with Workiva began as we started building our monitoring and alerting system.\r\n\r\n### How Does It Work?\r\n\r\n> This section dives into the technical details of how the system is built. If you’re just wondering what the outcome was, skip to the next section.\r\n\r\nAt the core of the system is the actual log message. To ensure all things are formatted and presented in the same way, we have a logging specification for each major language we use.\r\n\r\nWe have a layer of abstraction on top of each language that captures the language’s stdout and transforms it to follow the logging specification. These libraries also provide a platform for other information like telemetry, analytics, and tracing data.\r\n\r\nThe logs are then sent to Splunk as well as an AWS Kinesis stream. This stream allows us to process large amounts of data records in near real-time. Using AWS Lambda functions, we process and send the information to our GAE application for data storage.\r\n\r\nThe main reason we chose GAE over AWS for the rest of our application was so our support product was decoupled from our production product. It could have lived entirely in AWS if we were so inclined. Nonetheless, the information gets sent from Lambda to our GAE application created with Python and Flask.\r\n\r\nThe front-end of our web application was originally created with JavaScript & React, but we eventually ended up porting to Dart instead. This is due to the large investment in the Dart ecosystem our company has and the opportunity to dogfood our existing [open-source software](http://workiva.github.io/) and tooling.\r\n\r\n### State of Monitoring (2018)\r\n\r\nOver the past 3 years, we’ve worked tirelessly to create a product that revolutionizes the support process. It’s now a mature product with over 10,000 commits and 700 releases. Most importantly, we have achieved our goal of **100% of production services having near real-time alerting set up**.\r\n\r\nLet's walk through a typical use case of the product. First, a user will set up alerting rules so they are notified of the errors they care about. This could be a HipChat or Slack alert.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Build vs. Buy - Exception Monitoring`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/build-vs-buy/hubble-alert.png`}\r\n  width={1252}\r\n  height={304}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nFrom here, the user is taken to our application to inspect the error.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Build vs. Buy - Exception Monitoring`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/build-vs-buy/hubble-context-view.png`}\r\n  width={3360}\r\n  height={1820}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThis is the complete overview of this specific error. You'll see similar stack traces, relevant metadata, accounts/users affected, comments, JIRA tickets, and more.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Build vs. Buy - Exception Monitoring`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/build-vs-buy/hubble-errors-table.png`}\r\n  width={3256}\r\n  height={1665}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nErrors are segmented by projects. There are different projects for each environment (e.g. dev, sandbox, prod). The above image shows the project overview listing all errors for the given day. Users have the ability to search and filter their results to find what's most important.\r\n\r\nTeams are able to proactively fix issues before customers notice. We have processes in place to support the rollout of our next generation products. In almost all regards, this product was a success. However, has the rest of the industry caught up?\r\n\r\nWe periodically compare our application against other third-party and open-source solutions to see if we’re still providing more value (ideally at a lower cost). Most of the features we built over the past 3 years are now available in other solutions. The industry has caught up in most regards, as exception monitoring has become a necessity of supporting SaaS products.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nAs of right now, it is still cheaper for us to host our own solution versus migrating over to another provider. If hosting costs were to change, or the volume of logs was to drastically increase, this might not be true. This is why it’s important to constantly evaluate your product against others to determine when it’s right to build vs. buy. If your team currently doesn’t have any exception monitoring, we would recommend either [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) or [BugSnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/).\r\n",

    "image": "/static/images/building-my-first-electron-app/banner.png",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`YouTube To MP3 Logo`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/building-my-first-electron-app/banner.png`}\r\n  width={1200}\r\n  height={630}\r\n  priority\r\n/>\r\n\r\nIn my free time, I like to create videos. As part of my process for creating new videos, I usually need to download some audio to accompany the visuals. That might be the main song, some sound effects, or vocal tracks. I typically find the video on YouTube (copyright free, of course) and navigate to a website where I can convert and download the video as a .mp3 file. It's not a broken process, but it could be improved. I wasn't particularly fond of any of the user interfaces these websites had. It shouldn't be _that_ difficult to download one song. So why not just build something myself?\r\n\r\nWhenever I have an idea for a new project, I immediately want to dive into the code and start piecing together the start of the application. This is actually the **completely wrong approach**. I've found that it takes me less time to complete the work when I have the design already figured out ahead of time versus throwing it together as I go. I decided to put my money where my mouth is and jump into Photoshop.\r\n\r\n### Creating Mockups\r\n\r\nI defined a rough list of requirements for what my design should contain:\r\n\r\n- A macOS application versus a website\r\n- A large input that allows the user to enter a YouTube URL\r\n- A button to start the conversion process and begin the download\r\n- The input should transform into a progress bar after clicking the button\r\n\r\nHere are the mockups I created for my application:\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`YouTube To MP3 Mockup 1`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/building-my-first-electron-app/mock1.png`}\r\n  width={919}\r\n  height={525}\r\n/>\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`YouTube To MP3 Mockup 2`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/building-my-first-electron-app/mock2.png`}\r\n  width={919}\r\n  height={525}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nI strived to create a simple but visually appealing design. The soft, green to blue gradient in the background provides contrast against the large, rounded input. I emphasized the little things like:\r\n\r\n- Adding box shadows around the input and button\r\n- Using a crisp, clear font ([San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/))\r\n- Using a complementary color for the button to offset the background\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. This gave me a great base to begin with.\r\n\r\n### Building The Application\r\n\r\nI knew I wanted to use [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) to create this application, which is a framework created by GitHub.\r\nElectron enables developers to easily build cross-platform applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My editor of choice, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), is built with Electron.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to gain more experience with React and the JavaScript tooling that accompanies it (Babel? What is that again?). Let's look at the dependencies section of my [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json). This file documents all of the packages my project uses.\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n\"dependencies\": {\r\n  \"axios\": \"^0.9.1\",\r\n  \"babel-preset-es2015\": \"^6.6.0\",\r\n  \"babel-preset-react\": \"^6.5.0\",\r\n  \"babelify\": \"^7.2.0\",\r\n  \"electron-reload\": \"^0.2.0\",\r\n  \"electron-prebuilt\": \"^0.36.0\",\r\n  \"react\": \"^0.14.8\",\r\n  \"react-dom\": \"^0.14.7\"\r\n},\r\n\"devDependencies\": {\r\n  \"electron-packager\": \"^9.1.0\",\r\n  \"node-sass\": \"^4.5.3\",\r\n  \"watchify\": \"^3.9.0\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's look at what I've defined here:\r\n\r\n- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Send HTTP requests from the browser\r\n- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - Use the latest JavaScript features and compile your code to support older browsers\r\n- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces\r\n- [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) - CSS with superpowers\r\n\r\nThese libraries will be the building blocks of my application.\r\n\r\nElectron requires you to specify a main entry point into your application. It's mostly boilerplate, but here's a snippet that sets up the browser window and loads the HTML file. I will include a link to the full source code at the end of this post.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst browserOptions = {\r\n  width: 800,\r\n  height: 600,\r\n  maximizeable: false,\r\n  icon: path.join(__dirname, '/public/img/logo.png')\r\n};\r\n\r\nmainWindow = new BrowserWindow(browserOptions);\r\nmainWindow.loadURL('file://' + __dirname + '/index.html');\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the entirety of the `index.html` file it renders. This file simply includes the bundled JavaScript and CSS and not much else.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n  <head>\r\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\r\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"public/css/global.css\" />\r\n    <title>Youtube To MP3</title>\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <div class=\"root center\" id=\"root\"></div>\r\n    <script src=\"public/js/bundle.js\"></script>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice the `root` div. This is where the React code will be rendered into. All of the JavaScript code for this application will be compiled together and bundled into `bundle.js`.\r\n\r\nElectron is set up and there's a place for the React code to be written. Let's jump into creating some components.\r\n\r\n### Creating The Interface\r\n\r\nThe entry point for the React application is inside `app.js`. This file loads our components and renders them into `index.html`.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nimport AppContainer from './containers/app.container';\r\n\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <AppContainer />;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Render to index.html\r\nReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll notice I've defined `AppContainer`, which is the top-level class containing all the working pieces of the application. It's generally best practice to break up your components into two categories - smart and visual components (others might use different wording).\r\n\r\nFor example, the `AppContainer` is a smart component. It will contain the logic for making HTTP requests to retrieve YouTube videos, incrementing the progress bar, and initiating the file download. Inside of this component, you'll find the visual components which don't do any of the heavy lifting. Here's what the `AppContainer` renders.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nrender() {\r\n  if (this.state.showProgressBar) {\r\n    return <ProgressBar progress={this.state.progress} />;\r\n  } else {\r\n    return <LinkInput startDownload={this.startDownload} />;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ProgressBar` and `LinkInput` are the two visual components used in this application. The link input is initially shown which looks something like this.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nrender() {\r\n  let className = `link__input${this.state.showError ? '--error' : ''}`;\r\n  return <div>\r\n    <input className={className} onChange={this.updateInputValue} placeholder='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmXUWKwxDg4' />\r\n    <div className='center'>\r\n      <button className='link__button' onClick={this.startDownload}>Convert to .mp3</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne of my favorites features of [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) is string template literals.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n`link__input${this.state.showError ? '--error' : ''}`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's much easier to create strings with dynamic content now. You'll notice that if there's an error, I'm changing the class name to reflect that. I'm using [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) (Base-Element-Modifier) to define the naming structure of my CSS. Here's a snippet from the `link` base class in my global `.scss` file.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.link {\r\n  &__input {\r\n    width: 510px;\r\n    height: 60px;\r\n    border: 0;\r\n    border-radius: 10px;\r\n    box-shadow: $shadow;\r\n    color: $grey;\r\n    font-size: $font-size;\r\n    text-indent: 15px;\r\n    font-weight: 200;\r\n\r\n    &--error {\r\n      @extend .link__input;\r\n      box-shadow: 0 0 0 2pt rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.53);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  &__button {\r\n    height: 50px;\r\n    width: 200px;\r\n    box-shadow: $shadow;\r\n    border: 0;\r\n    border-radius: 10px;\r\n    color: white;\r\n    font-size: $font-size;\r\n    background: $pink;\r\n    margin-top: 10px;\r\n    font-weight: 200;\r\n    cursor: pointer;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSass will transform this code into three classes: `link__input`, `link__input--error`, and `link__button`. Notice `link` is the \"base\", the input is the \"element\", and error is one \"modifier\".\r\n\r\nThe `ProgressBar` component displays a loading bar disguised as an input which updates based on the percentage value passed in from its parent `AppContainer`. When it's nearing completion, the text color changes to white so there's sufficient contrast.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass ProgressBar extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    let percentComplete = `${this.props.progress}%`;\r\n    let color = '#747373';\r\n\r\n    if (this.props.progress > 90) {\r\n      color = 'white';\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <div className=\"progress\">\r\n          <div className=\"progress__bar\" style={{ width: percentComplete }} />\r\n          <div className=\"progress__percentage\" style={{ color: color }}>\r\n            {percentComplete}\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"center\">\r\n          <span className=\"progress__info\">\r\n            The video is currently being processed.\r\n          </span>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ProgressBar;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the `AppContainer` will handle the heavy lifting of fetching the videos from YouTube. I utilized an existing API for processing videos to MP3 to reduce duplication of efforts.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfetchVideo(id) {\r\n  let _this = this;\r\n  Axios.get(`http://www.yt-mp3.com/fetch?v=${id}&apikey=${this.api_key}`)\r\n    .then(function (response) {\r\n      if (response.data.status === 'timeout') {\r\n        _this.retryDownload(id);\r\n      } else if (response.data.url) {\r\n        _this.downloadFinished(response.data.url);\r\n      } else {\r\n        _this.retryDownload(id);\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n    .catch(function (err) {\r\n      alert('There was an error retrieving the video. Please restart the application.');\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Final Product 🎉\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`YouTube To MP3 Example`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/building-my-first-electron-app/example.gif`}\r\n  width={796}\r\n  height={596}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Source Code\r\n\r\nYou can [view the entire source code here](https://github.com/leerob/youtube-to-mp3).

      "raw": "\r\nHow did I go from a designer to a developer? In this post, I'll share my overnight success story – ten years in the making. First, we have to go way back to 2007.\r\n\r\n## Learning Design\r\n\r\nI was 14 and found myself fully immersed in the internet. Like many kids, I was an avid gamer. One of my favorites was Halo. I was on their gaming forums chatting with other Halo players. And for those around my age, you might remember something special at the bottom of every post - forum signature banners.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Old forum banners`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/career/banners.png`}\r\n  width={1280}\r\n  height={720}\r\n  priority\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThese were _so cool_. I thought \"I need to have one\". Luckily, I happened to grow up in the internet age. YouTube was getting popular and you could find tutorials on anything your heart desired.\r\n\r\nSo, 14-year-old me managed to follow the _sound_ advice of others online and download a _completely_ legal version of Photoshop (thanks Pirate Bay) to create my own banners. I learned about vectors, brush packs, masking, typography, you name it. And before I knew it, I was actually _pretty good_ at design.\r\n\r\n> **Takeaway:** Follow your curiosity.\r\n\r\n## Working as a Designer\r\n\r\nI continued to use my Photoshop skills mostly for practical jokes, like photoshopping my friends into epic landscapes or other silly things. When I turned 16, I was looking for a summer job and realized I had actually developed _marketable skills_ in the process of following my curiosity. A local t-shirt company was hiring designers to create vector illustrations for sports teams, events, schools, and more. You know, this kind.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Shirt designs`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/career/shirts.png`}\r\n  width={1280}\r\n  height={720}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nI applied, and surprisingly, I got hired. That summer, I churned out designs and learned more about Adobe Illustrator than I could have imagined. As high school graduation approached, it seemed natural I would continue with design in college (university). But a looming fear of a career as a designer led me to explore other options.\r\n\r\nI was worried about job stability and the intense cirriculum for designers at my college. In retrospect, I didn't have great guidance (easy to say in hindsight). Ultimately, I made the jump for engineering.\r\n\r\n> **Takeaway:** Chase your passions. You might just learn some valuable skills along the way.\r\n\r\n## Becoming an Engineer\r\n\r\nI started college and learned to code in 2011. I chose Computer Engineering because I built my own gaming computer once, and I was the \"IT\" person for my friends and family. Not exactly a strong foundation to build a career upon.\r\n\r\nMy first class was _Introduction to Computer Programming_. My professor asked, \"How many have had prior programming experience?\". More than half the class raised their hands. My hand stayed down. I became nervous.\r\n\r\nI struggled throughout my first year of school, scraping by with average grades and low self-esteem. I wanted to quit. \"I'm not smart enough to be a programmer\", I thought. In hindsight, I was actually just _learning the wrong things for me_.\r\n\r\n## What Didn't Work For Me\r\n\r\nIn our curriculum, students started out by learning the C programming language. For me, C was not the most enjoyable language to work with. I would be fine never having to manually allocate memory ever again. The only part that sparked joy was visualizing command line output.\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n\r\nint main( int argc, char *argv[] )  {\r\n   if( argc == 2 ) {\r\n      printf(\"The argument supplied is %s\\\\n\", argv[1]);\r\n   }\r\n   else if( argc > 2 ) {\r\n      printf(\"Too many arguments supplied.\\\\n\");\r\n   }\r\n   else {\r\n      printf(\"One argument expected.\\\\n\");\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, if I ran the program above and forwarded `hello` on the command line, I'd see `The argument supplied is hello`. Incredible! While I dreaded almost everything about C, it did start teaching me the fundamentals of programming: variables, loops, functions, and more.\r\n\r\nNext, we learned Java. This was a big improvement over C for me. No more [manual memory management](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)>)! And even more visual applications: [Java Swing](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)>). Now we're talking!\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Java Swing program`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/career/swing.png`}\r\n  width={1280}\r\n  height={720}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThe next semester we learned web development. This is where the pieces began to fall into place for me. The visual aspect of the web felt like the missing link between design and development. The web felt like a place I could experiment, build, and most importantly **share with anyone**.\r\n\r\n> **Takeaway:** To learn what's right for you, cast a wide net. Try many things.\r\n\r\n## Humble Beginnings\r\n\r\nEven though I was excited about the web, building web apps in 2012 wasn't as beginner-friendly as it is today. I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and even that [Bootstrap](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)>) library. Simple websites made sense, but then I was exposed to the world of back-end development... what in the world is a LAMP stack!?

I wanted to write, record, stream, post, tweet, and grow a community. I wanted to help others learn and progress in their careers as developers.

Your career is a marathon, not a sprint.\r\n\r\n## Takeaways & Advice\r\n\r\n1. Follow your curiosity.\r\n1. Chase your passions. You might just learn some valuable skills along the way.\r\n1. To learn what's right for you, cast a wide net. Try many things.\r\n1. You're not a failure if your first job isn't at a well-known company.

The principles of React have fundamentally changed how we build for the web.\r\n1. It's never too late to change your trajectory. Your career is a marathon, not a sprint.\r\n\r\nAlso, share your work. Tell people what you're building or learning.

You're applying for a new job. You submit your resume to Big Name Co™️. After glancing at it for 10 seconds, what does the hiring manager do?\r\n\r\n**They Google you.**\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Google`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/google.gif`}\r\n  width={1190}\r\n  height={108}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nHave you ever Googled yourself? Based on your online footprint and the uniqueness of your name, you may or may not show up on the first page. What if there was a way to improve your online presence and build your personal brand?\r\n\r\n### What Is Content Marketing?\r\n\r\nOne strategy to build your personal brand is called [content marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_marketing).\r\n\r\n> Content marketing is a form of marketing focused on creating, publishing, and distributing content for a targeted audience online.\r\n\r\nTypically, content marketing is used to attract and transform viewers into customers, but what if you're not selling anything?\r\n\r\nYou might not be explicitly selling a product, but you are **selling yourself**. You should view yourself as a business, and successful businesses usually have some form of marketing.\r\n\r\n### Why Should I Use Content Marketing?\r\n\r\nFor me personally, I learn best by _doing_. I wanted to drive more content to my portfolio, but I wasn't sure how. I decided to put more focus on creating informative, high-quality content in the form of blog posts. The results have been pretty staggering.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing my last post, [How Stripe Designs Beautiful Websites](/blog/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites), I posted a link to the article on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Article Initially Posted`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/originally-posted.png`}\r\n  width={1913}\r\n  height={589}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nI was immediately receiving 10x the traffic as before. The article ended up hitting #1 on Hacker News and [/r/web_design](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/).\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`#1 Hacker News Article`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/hacker-news.png`}\r\n  width={1680}\r\n  height={184}\r\n/>\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`#1 Reddit Article`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/reddit.png`}\r\n  width={1680}\r\n  height={184}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThis ultimately led to the article being reposted across a bunch of different websites. It continued to grow organically throughout the day, bringing in ~70,000 views in 24 hours.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Article Initially Posted`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/final-views.png`}\r\n  width={955}\r\n  height={472}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThis traffic created two notable events:\r\n\r\n- My average site traffic doubled\r\n- My portfolio moved from the 3rd page of Google to the 1st\r\n\r\nYou might be thinking \"That's great Lee, but would it work for me?\"\r\n\r\n### Who Is This For?\r\n\r\n- Are you looking for a new job?\r\n- Are you trying to network with your peers?\r\n- Do you aspire to become a [thought leader](http://randsinrepose.com/dont-skip-this/) in your industry?\r\n- Is your name Michael?\r\n\r\n_Just kidding_, reader named Michael who is a little freaked out right now.\r\n\r\nIf you answered yes to any of those questions, this article is for you. Let's use Michael as an example (Sorry Michael).\r\n\r\nMichael is a Computer Science graduate from a top university. During his time in college, he had a few internships with some reputable companies and managed to graduate with a 3.5 GPA. At the end of his college career, Michael [created an online portfolio](/blog/beginners-guide-to-the-programming-portfolio) to showcase his work in hopes of landing a job.\r\n\r\nLet's evaluate the market.\r\n\r\n> Who is Michael's target reader?\r\n\r\nProspective employers and fellow peers in the industry.\r\n\r\n> What are they looking for?\r\n\r\n- Examples showing he is a proficient programmer\r\n- High-quality content they can learn from\r\n- Impressive written communication skills\r\n\r\nMichael decides he wants to start a blog. His goals are to:\r\n\r\n- Effectively research and study new topics\r\n- Practice and exercise different skill sets\r\n- Develop and improve his writing abilities\r\n- Attract viewers that could lead to a job opportunity\r\n\r\nAsk yourself: Are you knowledgeable about something others would find value in reading? If the answer is yes, **start writing now**.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Spongebob`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/spongebob.gif`}\r\n  width={400}\r\n  height={300}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### How Can I Do It?\r\n\r\nOkay, by now I've convinced you this is a good idea. But how do you actually go about _doing_ it?\r\n\r\nI'll start by addressing the most difficult part: **You have to be authentic**. You're creating an online identity for yourself. It needs to be _your_ great ideas and thoughts. You can't write some half-assed article you threw together at 2 AM and didn't proofread. You're trying to build trust with the reader.\r\n\r\nYou need to produce **high-quality content**. You can't write one paragraph and call it good. You have to provide value to your readers. So how do you produce high-quality content?\r\n\r\n1.  Research the subject matter and become very familiar with it. You should be educating your readers.\r\n2.  Tell stories with your articles. Make your readers connect with you.\r\n3.  Use humor when appropriate 😄\r\n4.  Include pictures. They're worth 1000 words, remember?\r\n5.  Optimize your article for social media. Read about [meta tags](http://www.wordstream.com/meta-tags) and [open graph](http://ogp.me/).\r\n6.  Don't waste their time - Make your articles concise but still informative.\r\n\r\n### Share Your Content\r\n\r\nAfter you've created some content you're proud of, you should:\r\n\r\n- Proofread it, and then proofread it again.\r\n- Utilize a tool like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to help prevent spelling issues.\r\n- Share it on social media and any other industry-specific communities.\r\n- Send emails to connect with influencers.\r\n- Be active and respond to readers questions and inquiries.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my article. If you found it valuable, please leave me a comment below! I'd love to hear your thoughts 👍🏼\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\nReact attempts to be as unopinionated as possible. This is both it's greatest strength _and_ weakness.\r\n\r\nOver the years, I've tried many different ways to style my React apps. Each solution has its pros and cons.\r\nThis article will share my journey using CSS with React and how it's evolved to its current state. Then, I'll discuss pros/cons of\r\ndifferent approaches for styling.\r\n\r\n## Vanilla CSS\r\n\r\nLike most, I started web development with vanilla CSS. All you need is a single HTML and CSS file. Pretty simple.\r\n\r\n```html:index.html\r\n<h1 class=\"header\">Welcome</h1>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```css:index.css\r\n.header {\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I built more large applications, I began to understand some of the drawbacks.\r\n\r\n- **Reusability.** It's easy to create append-only stylesheets that become very complex.\r\n- **Global Namespace.** Since CSS has a [global namespace](https://css-tricks.com/regarding-css-global-scope/), you can unintentionally target too many elements.\r\n- **Colocation.** It's hard to modularize your CSS, which makes it difficult to delete code safely.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I was introduced to [CSS pre-processors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_preprocessor).\r\nThese tools aim to introduce new funtionality and compile back to vanilla CSS.\r\n\r\n## Sass\r\n\r\n[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), one of the most popular preprocessors, allows you to write more reusable, maintainable CSS.\r\nSome of the most popular features are [variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables), [mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin), and [modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules).\r\n\r\n- **Variables.** I want to define global values once and share them throughout my stylesheets.\r\n- **Mixins.** I want to reuse particular snippets of CSS.\r\n- **Modules.** I want to split up my CSS files for a more maintainable codebase.\r\n\r\n```scss:_base.scss\r\n$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n$primary-color: #333;\r\n\r\nbody {\r\n  font: 100% $font-stack;\r\n  color: $primary-color;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scss:_header.scss\r\n@use 'base';\r\n\r\n.header {\r\n  font-size: 32px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSass helped me write more modular, reusable CSS – at least, for a while. Over time, I ran into new issues.\r\n\r\n- **Naming.** As your CSS grows, it's easy to have class names get out of hand.\r\n- **Browser support.** Certain features aren't [supported across all browsers](https://caniuse.com/) and require [vendor prefixes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix) like `-moz-` (Firefox), `-webkit-` (Safari), and `-ms-` (Internet Explorer and Edge).\r\n\r\nTo solve naming, I started to adopt [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/).\r\nBlock Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components\r\nand organize CSS in a modular way, which keeps specificity low.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button class=\"button\">Cancel</button>\r\n<button class=\"button button--primary\">Submit</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.button {\r\n  color: black;\r\n  background-color: gray;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.button--primary {\r\n  color: white;\r\n  background-color: green;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNaming conventions helped but didn't fix the root cause: **naming is hard**.\r\nFor browser support, it's possible to set up your Sass toolchain with a tool like [autoprefixer](https://css-tricks.com/autoprefixer/) to handle vendor prefixes.\r\nHowever, around this time, I started using component-based frameworks like React. This led me to explore CSS-in-JS.\r\n\r\n## CSS-in-JS\r\n\r\nMy first adventure with CSS-in-JS: building a [component library with styled-components](/blog/ui-component-library-with-styled-components). At first, CSS-in-JS solved all my problems.\r\n\r\n- **Specificity** is solved by auto-generated class names.\r\n- **Colocation** is solved by putting CSS directly with the component, making it easy to delete code.\r\n- **Browser support** is solved by having autoprefixer built-in.\r\n- **Variables** are solved by creating a global theme.\r\n\r\nHowever, **naming** was still a huge pain.\r\n\r\nAs the component library grew, I began to explore [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com) and [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/).\r\nThese were more structured approaches to scaling CSS-in-JS to help enforce a design system.\r\nPlus, they helped solve naming. Trying to scale [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) alone in a large application made me get _really_ creative with names.\r\nYou can only have so many container, wrapper, layout things. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst HomeContainerWrapper = styled.div`\r\n   padding: 8px;\r\n   font-weight: bold;\r\n   color: white;\r\n   background: blue;\r\n`;\r\n\r\n<HomeContainerWrapper>\r\n  Hello\r\n</HomeContainerWrapper>\r\n\r\n// Forget about naming\r\n<Box\r\n  padding={3}\r\n  fontWeight='bold'\r\n  color='white'\r\n  bg='blue'\r\n>\r\n  Hello\r\n</Box>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, I know what you're thinking. Inline styles 🤮. I'll admit, I wasn't sold at first. But it grew on me – and that brings us to now.\r\n\r\n## Current State\r\n\r\nI've recently been working with [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).\r\nBoth of these approaches to styling React applications have prompted me to step back and evaluate the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nBelow, I've summarized pros and cons of various approaches to styling your React application. I tried to make this comparison as unopinionated as possible.\r\nThe choice that's best for you likely depends on:\r\n\r\n- Your experience (stick with what you know).\r\n- Your team.\r\n- The size of your application.\r\n- What you're trying to build.\r\n\r\n## Pros and Cons\r\n\r\n### Vanilla CSS\r\n\r\n<ProsCard\r\n  title=\"vanilla CSS\"\r\n  pros={[\r\n    `You don't want to add a toolchain. Vanilla CSS works with every browser & language.`\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<ConsCard\r\n  title=\"vanilla CSS\"\r\n  cons={[`You're building a large web application.`]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### CSS Modules\r\n\r\n[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) would be my choice for smaller teams that don't need to share\r\ncomponents across applications.\r\n\r\n[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) has support for CSS Modules, which means you don't have to worry about setting up [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).\r\nIt also sets up [autoprefixer](https://css-tricks.com/autoprefixer/) making CSS Modules an attractive alternative to CSS-in-JS in some cases.\r\n\r\n<ProsCard\r\n  title=\"CSS modules\"\r\n  pros={[\r\n    'You want class names scoped to the corresponding component.',\r\n    'You want to use CSS variables to reuse values.',\r\n    'You need your application to work without JavaScript.',\r\n    'You want the lowest barrier to entry.',\r\n    'You want to use any language, not just JavaScript.'\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<ConsCard\r\n  title=\"CSS modules\"\r\n  cons={[\r\n    `You don't want to configure a toolchain like Webpack.`,\r\n    'You need to distribute a package on NPM.',\r\n    'You want nesting support by default (requires PostCSS).',\r\n    `You don't want to context switch between files.`\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### CSS-in-JS\r\n\r\nThere's many different CSS-in-JS libraries. The two most popular are [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).\r\n\r\nThere's also zero-runtime solutions like [Linaria](https://github.com/callstack/linaria), where CSS is extracted to CSS files at build-time.\r\nTo see comparisons between different libraries, see [CSS-in-JS benchmarks.](https://github.com/A-gambit/CSS-IN-JS-Benchmarks)\r\n\r\n<ProsCard\r\n  title=\"CSS-in-JS\"\r\n  pros={[\r\n    'You want to distribute as reusable components on NPM.',\r\n    'You want to take advantage of anything in the JavaScript ecosystem.',\r\n    'You want to colocate styles with components, making it easy to delete code.',\r\n    'You need to support multiple themes.'\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<ConsCard\r\n  title=\"CSS-in-JS\"\r\n  cons={[\r\n    `You don't want to configure a toolchain like Webpack.`,\r\n    'You are sick of figuring out names for things.',\r\n    'You believe it breaks separation of concerns.',\r\n    `You don't want to enforce all consumers must use the same CSS-in-JS solution.`\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Theme UI / Styled System\r\n\r\nBoth [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com) and [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) abide by the [System UI theme specification](https://system-ui.com/).\r\nThis specification intends to help make UI components, libraries, and tools as interoperable as possible.\r\n\r\nThe primary use case for these libraries is implenting a component library and design system.\r\nOne of my favorite libraries is [Chakra UI](https://next.chakra-ui.com/).\r\n\r\n<ProsCard\r\n  title=\"Theme UI / styled-system\"\r\n  pros={[\r\n    `You're building a component library.`,\r\n    'You need to enforce a design system.',\r\n    'You want to spend less time trying to name components.'\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<ConsCard\r\n  title=\"Theme UI / styled-system\"\r\n  cons={[\r\n    'You dislike providing styles as props.',\r\n    'You believe it breaks separation of concerns.'\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Tailwind CSS\r\n\r\n[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) has been rapidly growing in popularity. Many people are frustrated with the bloat of CSS frameworks like\r\n[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and want an alternative. Tailwind provides an impressive developer experience with a refined API.\r\n\r\nWith the combination of [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/), you can easily build extensible, well-designed applications.\r\n\r\n<ProsCard\r\n  title=\"Tailwind\"\r\n  pros={[\r\n    'You want to never leave your HTML (or JSX).',\r\n    'You need to enforce a design system.',\r\n    'You want to spend less time trying to name components.'\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<ConsCard\r\n  title=\"Tailwind\"\r\n  cons={[\r\n    `You don't want (potentially) long class names.`,\r\n    `You don't want to learn Tailwind syntax, which is slightly different than standard CSS.`\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nI hope this article has helped demystify styling your React applications.

    "body": {
      "raw": "\r\nHere's a collection of opinions I hold on what makes a great Developer Experience (DX). Note that some of these apply more broadly than their category (e.g. frameworks).\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1476237583105601538\" />\r\n\r\n### Frameworks and Libraries\r\n\r\n- **Onboard as fast as possible:** To keep creatives in the flow, you want to enable them to get started as quickly as possible. Try to ensure frameworks and libraries optimize for getting started quickly. For example, `npx create-next-app` or `brew install bat`. Optimize for quick iterations and fast feedback loops to the developer.\r\n- **Make upgrading easy:** When making a major version change, limit the “blast radius” of the changes to make it easy for folks to update dependencies. Ideally, changes should start out opt-in with many months of lead time before landing in a major version. Then, major versions should include codemods – scripts that run code transforms to help automatically migrate code and fix breaking changes.\r\n- **Helpful error messages:** When applicable, include hyperlinks in error messages to provide more context on how to solve the error. Your tools should be providing you feedback as you type. The faster, the better (e.g. type checking, linting) before runtime or compilation errors. [Don't make me think](https://www.swyx.io/write-errors-that-don-t-make-me-think-24hg).\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1124787522909949952\" />\r\n\r\n- **Strong defaults and conventions:** Have an opinion about “the right way” to build software. For example, don't make me think about setting up routing, just use the file-system-based routing with Next.js. Don't make me configure compilation and bundling, just set up good defaults for me with webpack/swc/vite/esbuild.\r\n- **Provide escape hatches:** The counter to strong defaults is to make sure there are escape hatches when the developer wants to break from the standard configuration. One reason Next.js was successful in the beginning was being able to easily override webpack _without_ leaving the framework, whereas CRA required something like [craco](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco) after ejecting.\r\n- **Reduce risk with dependencies:** When you `npm i next`, you only install 13 dependencies from npm. The rest of the dependencies are inlined into Next.js to have faster installation times and improved security. In the future, we'd like to turn Next.js into a [single binary](/blog/rust) you can install.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- **Lead with code:** Developers want to write code. Give them code examples as starting blocks. Don't bury the lede.\r\n- **Solve the problem (aka: answer the question):** Developers come to docs to learn the answer to a question, challenge, or problem they're trying to resolve. Give them the answer through multiple methods (video, text, tutorials, guides, etc.), so they learn the solution in a way that works for them.\r\n- **Automated documentation:** When documenting an API, it's helpful to generate the docs from the source of truth (code) to ensure they remain in sync. For example, Vercel's API docs are auto-generated from its [OpenAPI spec](https://swagger.io/specification/).\r\n- **Not just the happy path:** The documentation is a reference guide for developers trying to get work done. Often, this means searching for an error and looking for a solution they can copy/paste. It's important to document the workaround and hacks, too. I'd rather acknowledge a gap in the product and _unblock_ the developer rather than leave them frustrated.\r\n- **Optimize for skimming:** Let's face it, we all skim. Especially when reading developer documentation. My eyes jump directly to code blocks, trying to find the solution to my given problem. To help provide the best DX, consider adding helpful code comments in the code snippets and showing multiple options or permutations of the desired feature/API.\r\n- **Be precise:** Avoid technical jargon and idioms. If you're using an acronym, spell it out the first time and don't assume the reader knows what it is. Your docs should be accessible for both beginners and experts. Consider putting content that's helpful for experts but not critical for the happy path in collapsible “deep dive” sections.\r\n- **Progressively expose complexity:** Keep the first-time experience crisp while progressively informing developers about more complex features as they continue building with the product. It's not feasible to expect developers to learn about the entirety of the platform to get started.\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1258579119740248066\" />\r\n\r\n### APIs\r\n\r\n- **Don't break API workflows:** API versioning should be very intentional and explicit. Err on the side of over-communication when making changes to APIs and give developers plenty of time to update to new versions. I've personally enjoyed Stripe's API versioning – they have [an excellent post](https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning) if you want to learn more. I've seen some instances where AWS sends a deprecation email about an API that's been stable for years, plus gives them years of upgrade time.\r\n- **Let me try out APIs quickly:** Some of my favorite API documentation allows you to generate an API key and try out endpoints in a few seconds. Some even recognize that you're already logged in and personalize the page based on your account information. [Square does this well](https://developer.squareup.com/explorer/square). I also like GraphiQL for this – you view the entire graph schema, make requests, run mutations, format your code, and more.\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1471351025252519936\" />\r\n\r\n## Related Reading\r\n\r\n- [The Case for Developer Experience](https://future.com/the-case-for-developer-experience/)\r\n- [The Radiating Circles of DX Architecture](https://dx.tips/circles)\r\n- [What Is Developer Experience? - Adam Wathan (Tailwind CSS) and Lee Robinson (Vercel)](https://developerexperience.buzzsprout.com/1806381/8744993)\r\n- [What is Experience Engineering?](https://quobix.com/articles/experience-engineering/)\r\n",

    "body": {
      "raw": "\r\nI've been leading the DevRel team at Vercel for [over a year now](/blog/head-of-devrel), growing from just myself to a team of six. I'm often asked questions like:\r\n\r\n- **What is DevRel?**\r\n- **What is DevRel like at Vercel?**\r\n- **Is DevRel a good fit for me?**\r\n- **Will I stop developing if I move to DevRel?**\r\n\r\nThis post aims to answer these questions, while elaborating on my philosophy behind DevRel and how I've scaled our team.\r\n\r\n## What is Developer Relations?\r\n\r\nYou might hear Developer Relations, Developer Advocates, and Developer Experience used interchangeably. They do have differences depending on the company, so I'll start with how I personally view DevRel.\r\n\r\nTo me, DevRel is helping **educate developers** and **grow our community**. There are pillars of DevRel that everyone on the team shares ownership for, like developer experience, quality control, and excellence in communication.\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1508908852330340370\" />\r\n\r\nPart of the reason DevRel teams are ran so differently depends on the type of company and industry. So, let's narrow down this post even further: **Developer Relations at DevTools or developer-led companies.**\r\n\r\n## What is DevRel like at Vercel?\r\n\r\n**DevRel is an integral part of everything we do at Vercel.** We care deeply about developers and their experience using our platform and tooling.\r\n\r\nIt starts from [Guillermo](https://twitter.com/rauchg) (our CEO) and works it's way down. Great DevRel teams stem from founders who empathize with developer pain. You'll often see `@rauchg` replying to folks on Twitter, asking for feedback on the product or helping customers succeed. He leads by example for the entire DevRel team to follow.\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1396320966934859780\" />\r\n\r\nSince DevRel is such a public facing role, the DevRel team represents the ethos of the company. When we host an event, create a video, meet with a customer, or any other interaction – it should _scream_ Vercel. I believe this comes from being a company that **leads with design**.\r\n\r\nDesign is user experience _and_ developer experience. It's the DNA of what makes Vercel successful. Everyone at Vercel sweats the details to provide an exceptional experience for customers. We're very blessed with some incredible designers who I've been able to shadow and learn from, helping me (and the rest of the DevRel team) lead with design in _everything_ we do.\r\n\r\nOne of my goals is to create a positive, uplifting, and vibrant community of developers who are excited about making the web faster. This means you'll find me or others on the team in GitHub, Twitter, Discord, Reddit, Facebook, Hacker News, and everywhere else online learning about how developers use our products and where we can improve.\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1517249071702024193\" />\r\n\r\nIn the process of educating developers about the tools and products we provide, we learn what is working well and what's not. Our team then is able to work with product to relay valuable customer insights so we can iterate towards the best customer experience.\r\n\r\n## Is DevRel right for me?\r\n\r\nI truly believe the demand for DevRel (and content creation in general) is only going to continue increasing at a rapid pace. But I think it's also important to stress you don't _need_ to quit your job to validate if DevRel is right for you.\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1383873047619276812\" />\r\n\r\nYou can start creating content today – it's permissionless. No one is stopping you from writing that blog post, creating that video, or teaching others about tech you find interesting. While it's definitely easier to transition from an existing developer/programmer/engineer into DevRel, it's possible to start with DevRel as your first role.\r\n\r\nLet's assume you're looking to move into DevRel from engineering, which is the most common path. Here are some questions to ask yourself, along with my own responses that led me to switch to DevRel.\r\n\r\n> Are you finding your engineering work fulfilling?\r\n\r\nI felt limited, wanting to do more than just code. I knew my experience and skills in writing, design, and video creation could be better utilized. I'd actually had design teams shut down my suggestions to help improve the user experience of the product before.\r\n\r\n> If you need to write a one or two-page document outlining an architecture design for a feature you're working on, does that sound fun or dreadful?\r\n\r\nYes. I love writing. Especially clearly articulating tradeoffs for architecture decisions. If we do this, what are the pros? Cons? How does it impact our product in 6 months? 1 year?\r\n\r\n> Do you enjoy staying up to date with the latest tools and libraries in your space?\r\n\r\nYes. I love to learn and experiment with new tech. It helps programming feel fresh to me. To be a developer is to be a lifelong learner.\r\n\r\n> Do you like to work across teams? Do you enjoy communicating with marketing and product?\r\n\r\nYes. I have an entrepreneurial heart and love seeing and being involved with all parts of how the business runs.\r\n\r\n> Are you the type of person who enjoys debates? Can you articulate your points clearly?\r\n\r\nIt's a skill I've developed over time. Having empathy for other developers and being able to understand their situation and constraints is key.\r\n\r\n## Will I stop developing if I move to DevRel?\r\n\r\nNo, you should continue coding. You can't lose sight of the “developer” part of Developer Relations. To understand and empathize with developers, you need to put yourself in their shoes. Especially if you're advocating for a product developers use.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's assume you're advocating for a database. You might start to get questions like:\r\n\r\n- How does this database compare against [competitor]?\r\n- When would I use [feature] over [feature]?\r\n- What's the best way to build an [industry-specific] app using this database?\r\n- How should I model my data to stay within the free tier?\r\n\r\nIt's going to be hard to accurately answer these questions if you don't have hands-on experience developing using the product. You should be the first user of beta features and the first to provide feedback to the product team on what's going well (and maybe not so well).\r\n\r\n## Growing DevRel Teams\r\n\r\nHigh trust teams are [high growth teams](/blog/hypergrowth). I want to create a team that trusts each other, has autonomy to get their work done, and is given ownership over some part of the experience.\r\n\r\nFor example, on my team each member has a specific area of focus and ownership. This helps them have a north star for the type of content they're creating, and also allows them to get invested in that segment of the community.\r\n\r\nI have a few non-negotiables in terms of how DevRel teams should be ran:\r\n\r\n1. It doesn't matter if DevRel reports to marketing, product, engineering, or directly to the CEO. What matter is how the team is given ownership, autonomy, and what metrics [quantify their success](https://www.swyx.io/measuring-devrel).\r\n2. DevRel teams represent the company, but they are also individuals, often with their own following or areas of interest. It's the wrong approach to try and box creatives into company/team structures of the past. The new age of developer creatives are more like professional knowledge athletes, where they represent companies or teams but also have their own independent initiatives.\r\n3. The company does not control your social media accounts. You should never be forced to tweet/share something on behalf of the company from your personal account. Many advocates have worked hard to create an audience that finds their work valuable, and shouldn't be pressured to dilute that. I've heard some horror stories about this and feel pretty strongly about it. You should be creating content or products _so good_ that advocates _want_ to talk about them.\r\n4. You can always, _always_ learn something from your customers. Even when they're complaining on Twitter or upset in GitHub issues. Leading with empathy and a genuine curiosity in how the product could be better will lead to insights others might have ignored. Engaging with upset developers can be tricky, but ultimately [rewarding if done well](/blog/handling-dev-twitter-like-rappers).\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like a team you'd want to work on, I'm hiring. While I'm open to folks looking for more general DevRel roles, I'm _very_ interested if you match these descriptions:\r\n\r\n- You're passionate about build systems, monorepos, CLIs, and making ship happen. This person would work closely with the [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) team, as well as every part of building and deploying code on the Vercel platform. You can discuss tradeoffs of how web apps are architected and love to help developers improve performance in every possible way.\r\n- You're passionate about the web, and the growing ecosystem of tools and companies often working together to craft incredible user experiences. You may find yourself trying out the latest database, or the new component library posted on Hacker News. You like to stitch together tools and build examples showcasing interesting open-source libraries. You can craft an impressive Notion doc. This person would work closely with all of our technology partners, like databases, content platforms, ecommerce tools, and more.\r\n\r\nThat's all for now. Drop me an email at `lee@vercel.com` with three paragraphs on why you'd be a good fit if you're interested in joining.\r\n",

Your font choice can be critical for branding, readability, and performance.\r\n\r\n[Over time](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/web-fonts/), recommendations for using web fonts have changed as browsers adopted new standards. Now in 2021, I wanted to learn the best practices for using web fonts on high-performance sites.\r\n\r\n## System Fonts\r\n\r\nThe fastest way to use a web font is none. Browsers include a set of [web-safe fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#Web_safe_fonts) (e.g. Arial, Georgia, Times New Roman) you can use by default.\r\n\r\nUsing web-safe fonts or the [system font stack](https://systemfontstack.com/) will be the fastest option.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nfont-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial,\r\n  sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol';\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Why Use Web Fonts?\r\n\r\nIf system fonts are the fastest option, why do web fonts exist? Branding, improved design, and cross browser and device consistency. [82% of web pages for desktop](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/fonts) use web fonts.\r\n\r\nLet's cover five different areas for high-performance web fonts and conclude with a 2021 recommendation.\r\n\r\n- Self Hosting\r\n- Preloading\r\n- Font Display\r\n- Variable Fonts\r\n- Subsetting\r\n\r\n## Self Hosting\r\n\r\n[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is responsible for [70% of all web font usage](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/fonts#serving-with-a-service). With over 1000 fonts, they provide easy access to quality fonts, multiple formats, and performant defaults (pre-connecting and swapping).\r\n\r\nHowever, **Google Fonts is no longer necessary**. Since 2018, [Google has advised self-hosting](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/08/web-performance-made-easy) for optimal performance through preloading.\r\n\r\nThere aren't any caching advantages anymore, either. Let's say you're using the font \"Roboto\", which is [a popular font](https://fonts.google.com/?sort=popularity) on Google Fonts. Chances are you've visited another site using \"Roboto\" and cached the font.\r\n\r\nSince October 2020, Chrome [no longer allows](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning) a shared cache across sites. Safari has worked this way since 2013. \"Roboto\" will be re-downloaded for every site, regardless of it being cached.\r\n\r\nWhen self-hosting, ensure you cache your font with the `Cache-Control` HTTP header. `immutable` tells the browser the file will never change. When a request is made within the `max-age` (1 year), it avoids the roundtrip to ensure it's the latest content.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nCache-Control: public, immutable, max-age=31536000\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you need Google Fonts, [use these optimizations](https://csswizardry.com/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/). With the latest changes in the v2 API, you can tailor fonts to specific users and platforms (including variable fonts).\r\n\r\n## Preloading\r\n\r\nThe browser assigns [loading priorities](https://web.dev/prioritize-resources/) to different types of resources. By default, CSS will be loaded before scripts and images. You can influence the importance of resources by [preloading critical assets](https://web.dev/preload-critical-assets/).\r\n\r\nFonts are discovered late by the browser by default. By preloading, we fetch the font file as soon as possible. Then, the browser caches the font making it available immediately.\r\n\r\nPreloading can improve performance metrics like [Time to Interactive](https://web.dev/interactive) and [First Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint). For example, Shopify saw a [50% (1.2 second) improvement](https://twitter.com/ShopifyEng/status/844245243948163072) in First Contentful Paint, removing their Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT).\r\n\r\nAs of 2020, [75% of web fonts use WOFF2](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/fonts). You likely only need this. For example:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n<link\r\n\trel=\"preload\"\r\n\thref=\"/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2\"\r\n\tas=\"font\"\r\n\ttype=\"font/woff2\"\r\n\tcrossOrigin=\"anonymous\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Support: All modern browsers except Firefox.\r\n\r\n## Font Display\r\n\r\n`font-display` allows you to modify the rendering behavior of web fonts with values such as `auto`, `swap`, `block`, `fallback` and `optional`. When loading web fonts, we want to prevent [layout shift](https://web.dev/cls/). This occurs in two ways:\r\n\r\n- Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT) — The fallback font is swapped with a new font (e.g. `swap`).\r\n- Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT) — Invisible text is shown on the page until a new font is rendered (e.g. `block`).\r\n\r\nBrowsers currently have a default strategy similar to `block`. The only option that eliminates layout shift is `optional`. Combined with the other performance optimizations in this article, `optional` is your best choice.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@font-face {\r\n  font-family: 'Inter';\r\n  font-style: normal;\r\n  font-display: optional;\r\n  src: url(/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2) format('woff2');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Support: All modern browsers\r\n\r\n## Variable Fonts\r\n\r\n[Variable fonts](https://web.dev/variable-fonts/) allow us to combine multiple styles and weights (e.g. bold, italic) into a single font file.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@font-face {\r\n  font-family: 'Inter';\r\n  font-style: normal;\r\n  font-weight: 100 900; // Range of weights supported\r\n  font-display: optional;\r\n  src: url(/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2) format('woff2');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can try out different variable font options [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide).\r\n\r\n> Support: All modern browsers. Even Google Fonts v2 API has support for variable fonts.\r\n\r\n## Subsettings\r\n\r\nFont files contain multiple languages and glyphs, which increase the file size. Subsetting is the removal of characters you don’t need.\r\n\r\nFor example, we might use the Inter variable font and subset to latin languages.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@font-face {\r\n  font-family: 'Inter';\r\n  font-style: normal;\r\n  font-weight: 100 900; // Range of weights supported\r\n  font-display: optional;\r\n  src: url(/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2) format('woff2');\r\n  unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA,\r\n    U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215,\r\n    U+FEFF, U+FFFD;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\n1. Use a variable font\r\n2. Preload your font file\r\n3. Self-host instead of Google Fonts\r\n4. Use `font-display: optional` to prevent layout shift\r\n\r\n[Here's an example](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) of a site implementing all these recommendations.\r\n\r\n## Future\r\n\r\nIf you need to use `font-display: swap`, future support for [Font Metrics Override](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=176&v=Z6wjUOSh9Tk&feature=youtu.be) will reduce layout shift when swapping.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@font-face {\r\n  font-family: ...;\r\n  src: ...;\r\n  ascent-override: 80%;\r\n  descent-override: 20%;\r\n  line-gap-override: 0%;\r\n  ...;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\nYou want to start creating videos for developers but are unsure where to start. It seems daunting – what equipment do I need? How do I edit videos? How do I make them good quality? How do I distribute them?\r\n\r\nThis guide will teach you everything you need to know to start creating videos for a technical audience. It will explain the fundamentals behind video production and explain the terms you need to know. It will show you how to have excellent video quality in your home studio.\r\n\r\nI create videos for my job (in Developer Relations) and have worked as a freelance videographer in the past. This multi-part guide will share tips I've learned over years of creating videos and also include a purchasing guide to save you time. I've done the research, and have different recommendations based on your price range.\r\n\r\n- **Part 1: Fundamentals of Video**\r\n- Part 2: Video Equipment & Purchasing Guide\r\n- Part 3: Shooting Videos & Screencasts\r\n- Part 3: Editing & Distributing\r\n\r\n## Why Video?\r\n\r\nVideo is quickly becoming the most common way people consume content. With the global adoption of smartphones higher than ever ([80% of the total population in some countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_smartphone_penetration)) and improvements to internet speeds, it's easier than ever to stream video. That's why TikTok was one of the [most visited websites in the world](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2021/12/26/tiktok-is-now-the-most-visited-website-in-2021and-other-small-business-tech-news-this-week) in 2021.\r\n\r\n## Reusing Content\r\n\r\nCreators can reuse content in many ways and redistribute it to multiple platforms. Podcasts do this well. They shoot an hour-long video and have:\r\n\r\n- The original video version\r\n- Audio-only version\r\n- Individual clips\r\n\r\nThen, they can distribute this content in multiple ways:\r\n\r\n- Audio streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music)\r\n- Full video to platforms encouraging longer content (YouTube)\r\n- Individual clips to social media platforms\r\n\r\nWhen combined with delegating parts of the creative process (filming, editing, uploading), this can be highly effective for creators. They sit down and have four conversations with guests a month (at an hour each) and have generated 10x content for months to follow.\r\n\r\nMost videos should start with a script. A well-written script is the first step of creating an exceptional video. But you've just created another piece of content to distribute – your writing! The same script used for your video can be used for a blog post or a series of tweets.\r\n\r\n## Video Outputs & Shot Types\r\n\r\nDifferent video formats require different research, planning, scripting, and output. There are two ways to deliver video: **pre-recorded** or **live**. Live video is gaining popularity but is more challenging than pre-recoded video. For both output types, there are a few common types of shots:\r\n\r\n- **Screen recordings:** Showing your editor, terminal, or browser as you explain a topic with audio.\r\n- **Talking heads:** A close-up shot of your subject, where they're speaking to the camera. The term [talking head](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/talking%20head) comes from traditional media.\r\n- **Mobile-first:** An important separate type because it's typically filmed vertically instead of horizontally.\r\n\r\n## Fundamentals of Video\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at the terminology and concepts you'll need to understand to successfully create your first video.\r\n\r\n### Camera\r\n\r\nYou can film your videos with your phone, and it's arguably a better option for certain distribution platforms (like TikTok), but you'll want to invest in a [DSLR camera](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/photography/discover/dslr-camera.html) for higher quality eventually. You'll hear lots of new terms from the videography industry, so let's break down some of the most important ones.\r\n\r\nWhile some of these terms only apply to DSLR cameras, they're good to know even if you're shooting on an iPhone. In general, the goal is to end up with a shot that's not too dark and not too bright; instead, you want a shot that's _just right_, one with lots of detail.\r\n\r\n- **Aperture:** how much light is let into your camera (specifically your sensor). Aperture is measured in terms of _f-stops_ (f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, etc.). Lower f-stop, more light. Higher f-stop, less light.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Aperture`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/video/aperture.png`}\r\n  width={1422}\r\n  height={556}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n- **Exposure:** the brightness of your shot. If a shot is over-exposed, it's too bright and certain parts become “washed out”. If it's under-exposed, it's hard to make out all of the details and the footage can become grainy. Aperture affects your exposure.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Exposure`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/video/exposure.png`}\r\n  width={720}\r\n  height={480}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n- **Shutter speed:** the length of time the camera shutter is open while taking a photo. Aperture is measured in sections or fractions of seconds (1/125s, 1/250s, 1/500s, etc.). Shutter speed can affect exposure and the sharpness of your video. For most developer content, you'll likely have a fixed shutter speed for talking heads.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Shutter speed`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/video/shutter-speed.png`}\r\n  width={950}\r\n  height={334}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n- **ISO:** how sensitive your camera is to light. A higher ISO means brighter shots. ISO is measured in numbers (100, 200, 800, 1600, etc.). The goal is to keep a low ISO (100) for the best quality. For the type of content developers are producing, you can usually control your environment and lighting to allow for this to happen. Situations where you're filming and it's dark would require a higher ISO or external lighting.\r\n- **Frame rate:** A video is really just a bunch of pictures (frames). The frames per second, or FPS, is how we measure frame rate. Movies & TV typically use 24fps to allow for motion blur. To film slow motion, you want to have a higher fps (60fps or 120fps) to allow for additional frames when you're stretching the video out. Otherwise, the video will look choppy when slow instead of fluid.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Frame rate`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/video/motion-blur.png`}\r\n  width={650}\r\n  height={364}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n- **Resolution:** You've probably heard 1080p, which is HD. This is 1920 pixels wide and 1080 pixels tall, expressed as 1920x1080. There's also 4K, which confusingly has 3840x2160 for UHD and 4096x2160 for “cinema” 4K.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Resolution`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/video/resolution.png`}\r\n  width={745}\r\n  height={457}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Lens\r\n\r\nA camera is only as good as its lens. Further, different **focal lengths** affect how the image looks.\r\n\r\nThe longer the focal length of a lens, the narrow its angle of view. Subjects _appear_ larger with longer focal length lenses than they do with our eyes. Inversely, short focal lengths make subjects seem much smaller than they do to our eyes.\r\n\r\nFaces are an excellent demonstration. Long focal lengths make faces appear rounder. Shorter focal lengths make faces appear thinner and amplify features such as noses and eyes.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Focal lengths`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/video/focal-lengths.gif`}\r\n  width={750}\r\n  height={750}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nExtremely low focal lengths are called _ultra-wide_ (e.g. 16mm). This is now popularly known as the [GoPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoPro) look, although any lens at that focal length can recreate the same look. For example, 0.5x zoom on an iPhone camera is equivalent to a 13mm focal length.\r\n\r\nExtremely high focal lengths are called _telephoto_ and work best for outdoor shooting where you have plenty of space between the camera and subject.\r\n\r\nThe longer the focal length, the further away you have to place the camera from the subject, which makes filming in small spaces inconvenient. This is why most developers use a wide or ultra-wide lens for indoor shooting.\r\n\r\nDifferent camera brands have [different types of mounts](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/camera-lens-mounts-types-adapter/) (e.g. A-mount, E-mount, etc.). You need to ensure your lens mount matches your camera. For example, Sony cameras have an E-mount. You'll need to use E-mount lenses, or purchase an [adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_adapter).\r\n\r\n### Audio\r\n\r\nAudio quality is arguably more important than video quality. Why? **Bad audio quality is worse than bad video quality**. _Especially_ when doing screen recordings.\r\n\r\nThe goal when recording audio is to prevent [clipping](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(audio)>) – when the audio is too loud and information is lost. You can always raise the volume of your recording, but you can't fix clipped audio. You prevent clipping by monitoring your audio and ensuring the level doesn't “peak”. Aim to record at -12db (decibels).\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Peaks`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/video/peaks.png`}\r\n  width={1040}\r\n  height={771}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nIt's also important to control your environment. Have you ever seen images of artists singing in the studio? Their setup has been [acoustically treated and soundproofed](https://ehomerecordingstudio.com/acoustic-treatment-101/).\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Recording studio`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/video/studio.png`}\r\n  width={770}\r\n  height={436}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nSoundproofing is the process of making a room resistant to the passage of sound waves. You're blocking sounds from entering the room and preventing internal sounds from escaping. Certain materials, like the paneling on the wall above, absorb and trap sound waves.\r\n\r\nYou also want to prevent _[plosives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive)_ (e.g. words with the letter P) from introducing popping sounds. This can make your recording sound unprofessional. This is what [pop filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_filter) and windscreens in front of mics prevent.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Pop filter`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/video/pop-filter.png`}\r\n  width={1200}\r\n  height={800}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Lighting\r\n\r\nTo nail the professional look, you don't want to rely on natural lighting. You need a predictable, reliable way to light your subject. The most common way is to have a three-point lighting setup with a key, fill, and (hair/rim) light. I recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_Sov3xmgwg) to learn more.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Lighting`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/video/lighting.png`}\r\n  width={640}\r\n  height={355}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nA lot of lighting comes down to artistic preference. If you want the dramatic look, maybe you only use a single key light so there are more shadows.\r\n\r\nYou will also want to _diffuse_ the light. This prevents lighting from looking harsh and unnatural, and instead better reflects natural lighting.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever seen a professional photography studio, you've likely seen lights with diffusers. They often look like umbrellas or large circular coverings on top of lights.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Photo studio`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/video/diffused.png`}\r\n  width={700}\r\n  height={393}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThat's a wrap on the fundamentals of video.

Different languages and frameworks come and go and vary in popularity. There isn't one right way to do things and ultimately it's about weighing the pros and cons of the available tools at your disposable. The goal of this document is to inform you about another option you may have not previously considered: using React with Dart.\r\n\r\n## Table of Contents\r\n\r\n- [What is Dart?](/blog/getting-started-with-dart-and-react#what-is-dart)\r\n- [Why React?](/blog/getting-started-with-dart-and-react#why-react)\r\n- [Requirements](/blog/getting-started-with-dart-and-react#requirements)\r\n- [Getting Started](/blog/getting-started-with-dart-and-react#getting-started)\r\n- [Building & Running](/blog/getting-started-with-dart-and-react#building-&-running)\r\n- [Dart Development Environment](/blog/getting-started-with-dart-and-react#dart-development-environment)\r\n- [Building the Application](/blog/getting-started-with-dart-and-react#building-the-application)\r\n- [Testing](/blog/getting-started-with-dart-and-react#testing)\r\n- [Continuous Integration](/blog/getting-started-with-dart-and-react#continuous-integration)\r\n- [Deploying](/blog/getting-started-with-dart-and-react#deploying)\r\n- [Your Turn](/blog/getting-started-with-dart-and-react#your-turn)\r\n- [Additional Resources](/blog/getting-started-with-dart-and-react#additional-resources)\r\n\r\n## What is Dart?\r\n\r\nDart is a programming language originally [developed by Google](https://dart.dev/) for building complex web applications. It's a [statically-typed](https://dart.dev/guides/language/sound-dart) alternative to JavaScript that compiles to JS for use in the browser. It's open-source, easy to learn, and easy to scale. But wait, there's more!\r\n\r\n- Strong IDE integration (code completion, code navigation, static analysis, etc.)\r\n- Strong core set of common libraries (async, collections, isolates, etc.)\r\n- Excellent development ecosystem\r\n- Multi-threading support\r\n- And [much, much more](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour)\r\n\r\nGoogle uses Dart for [AdWords](https://news.dartlang.org/2016/03/the-new-adwords-ui-uses-dart-we-asked.html) which makes up the majority of Google's revenue.\r\nIt's also the language used at [Workiva](https://www.workiva.com/) for their next-generation products.\r\nWorkiva has committed to using Dart and has published a [variety of OSS (open-source software) libraries](https://workiva.github.io/) to make developer's lives easier.\r\nIf you're curious, here's a list of some companies [who use Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/community/who-uses-dart).\r\n\r\n## Why React?\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned at the start of this article, it's important to thoroughly evaluate all of the different framework options before choosing what's right for your team or company. I won't go too in-depth here on [React](https://reactjs.org/) vs. [Angular](https://angular.io/) since there are a [variety of articles](https://www.google.com/search?q=react+vs+angular) that dive into specifics, but I will note a couple wins for React:\r\n\r\n- Uni-directional data flow\r\n- Declarative nature of rendering views\r\n- XML-like syntax called JSX\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nLet's assume we are given some requirements to create a todo list as shown below. To help us [\"think\" in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html), I've outlined the design with boxes for each React component.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Todo List Spec Outlined`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/getting-started-with-dart-and-react/spec-outlined.png`}\r\n  width={1078}\r\n  height={892}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nThe IDE you choose is mostly personal preference, but here are some I suggest for Dart:\r\n\r\n- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Free)\r\n- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (Requires License)\r\n\r\nYou can clone the git repository with the todo application by running:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/leerob/dart-react-todo.git\r\n$ cd dart-react-todo\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Installing Dart\r\n\r\nYou can install Dart on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ brew tap dart-lang/dart\r\n$ brew install dart\r\n```\r\n\r\nServing Dart applications in a Web browser is done using the `webdev` command. This should be activated globally - instead of on a project-by-project basis:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pub global activate webdev\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Building & Running\r\n\r\nThe Dart SDK comes with a [tool called `pub`](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd) to help manage your codebase. The most common command `pub get` is used to download a package's dependencies. This is the first thing you will need to do when checking out an\r\nexisting Dart repository.\r\n\r\nIn addition to getting dependencies, you simply need to serve the application to view it in a browser:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pub get\r\n$ webdev serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, we can open up http://localhost:8080/ to see the todo application.\r\n\r\n### Building vs. Serving\r\n\r\nSome Dart libraries _(like `over_react`)_ - use builders to generate files \"under the hood\". When you first\r\nopen a project that contains over_react components in an IDE like Webstorm - you may see a bunch of\r\nanalysis errors in the \"Dart Analysis\" tab - even after you run `pub get`. This happens because there are\r\nreferences to objects that have not been built yet. In order to get rid of the analysis errors in your IDE,\r\nrun `pub run build_runner build` from the root of the project, then restart the analysis server. Note that\r\nserving the app via `webdev serve` will also perform the same build.\r\n\r\n## Dart Development Environment\r\n\r\nThe Dart SDK ships with tools to help you hit the ground running instead\r\nof having to set up your own development and build environments for each\r\nproject. These tools provide dependency management, code compilation /\r\nminification, and debugging support out of the box.\r\n\r\n### Directory & File Structure\r\n\r\nDart has a prescribed directory structure in order to ensure that its tools work\r\nout of the box.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nyour_app/\r\n├── lib/\r\n│   └── src/\r\n├── test/\r\n├── tool/\r\n├── web/\r\n├── pubspec.lock\r\n└── pubspec.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **`lib/`**\r\n  - Contains all internal implementation code.\r\n- **`test/`**\r\n  - Contains all unit, integration, and functional tests.\r\n- **`tool/`**\r\n  - Contains development tools, scripts, and configuration.\r\n- **`web/`**\r\n  - This directory is served by default when running the application. It is common to\r\n    include an `index.html` file in this directory.\r\n- **`pubspec.yaml`**\r\n  - This file defines all the metadata about your package such as name, version, authors,\r\n    dependencies, etc.\r\n- **`pubspec.lock`**\r\n  - This file specifies the version of each dependency installed in the project.\r\n    It will be automatically updated when dependencies change in\r\n    `pubspec.yaml` or by running `pub upgrade`. **[It should only be committed in application packages](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/private-files)**\r\n\r\n### dart_dev\r\n\r\n[dart_dev](https://github.com/Workiva/dart_dev) is a centralized tooling package built on top of the Dart SDK. All Dart projects eventually share a common set of development requirements:\r\n\r\n- Tests (unit, integration, and functional)\r\n- Code coverage\r\n- Consistent code formatting\r\n- Static analysis to detect issues\r\n- Documentation generation\r\n\r\nThe Dart SDK provides the necessary tooling to accomplish the tasks mentioned above but lacks a consistent usage pattern across multiple projects. Using dart_dev, a single configuration file will get our project configured and ready to use a variety of command line arguments.\r\n\r\nFor example: let's format the entire code base.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pub run dart_dev format\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make things even more simple, we can set up a bash alias\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ alias ddev='pub run dart_dev'\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich turns the previous command into:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ddev format\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Building the Application\r\n\r\nNow that we have an understanding of the language/tools we're working with, let's start creating the application! We will be utilizing some of Workiva's OSS.\r\n\r\n### OverReact\r\n\r\n[OverReact](https://workiva.github.io/over_react/) is a library for building statically-typed React UI components. Since OverReact is built on top of React, I strongly encourage you to gain familiarity with React first if you're not by reading [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html). The example below compares a `render()` function for JSX and OverReact that will have the exact same HTML markup result.\r\n\r\n**React** (JSX):\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nrender() {\r\n  return <div className=\"container\">\r\n    <h1>Click the button!</h1>\r\n    <button\r\n      id=\"main_button\"\r\n      onClick={_handleClick}\r\n    >Click me</button>\r\n  </div>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**OverReact** (Dart):\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nrender() {\r\n  return (Dom.div()..className = 'container')(\r\n    Dom.h1()('Click the button!'),\r\n    (Dom.button()\r\n      ..id = 'main_button'\r\n      ..onClick = _handleClick\r\n    )('Click me')\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOverReact helps bridge the gap between Dart and React. If you're using VS Code, you can utilize [OverReact code snippets](https://github.com/JaceHensley/vscode-over-react-snippets) to help speed up your development. Now, let's talk about our front-end architecture.\r\n\r\n### w_flux\r\n\r\n[w_flux](https://github.com/Workiva/w_flux) is an architecture library with uni-directional data flow that provides an MVC like architecture and works well with React UI components.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`w_flux Diagram`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/getting-started-with-dart-and-react/flux_diagram.png`}\r\n  width={2102}\r\n  height={330}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThis library was inspired by [RefluxJS](https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs) and Facebook's [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/). The same general principles apply here. For more information, please read the [README](https://github.com/Workiva/w_flux) in the w_flux repository.\r\n\r\n### Defining Dependencies\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, we'll use the `pubspec.yaml` file in our root directory to define the dependencies for our project. Let's take a look at the `pubspec.yaml` for the todo list.\r\n\r\n```yaml:pubspec.yaml\r\nname: todo_dart_react\r\nversion: 2.0.0\r\ndescription: Dart + React Todo List Example\r\nhomepage: https://github.com/leerob/dart-react-todo\r\nauthor: Lee Robinson <me@leerob.io>\r\n\r\nenvironment:\r\n  sdk: '>=2.5.0 <3.0.0'\r\n\r\ndependencies:\r\n  over_react: ^2.5.2\r\n  w_flux: ^2.10.3\r\n  react: ^4.9.1\r\n\r\ndev_dependencies:\r\n  build_runner: ^1.7.0\r\n  build_test: ^0.10.8\r\n  build_web_compilers: ^2.4.0\r\n  dart_dev: ^2.2.0\r\n  dart_style: ^1.2.9\r\n  over_react_test: ^2.5.1\r\n  test: ^1.6.10\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file tells `pub` which versions of the included packages it needs to retrieve. You can find more information about what all can be included in this file [here](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec).\r\n\r\n### /web/\r\n\r\nInside the `web` directory, we'll find the entry point into our application. This file sets up the `Actions` and `Store` for our Flux architecture. Then, it creates a new `TodoApp` component and renders it into our container.\r\n\r\n```dart:main.dart\r\nimport 'dart:html';\r\n\r\nimport 'package:over_react/over_react.dart';\r\nimport 'package:over_react/react_dom.dart' as react_dom;\r\n\r\nimport 'package:todo_dart_react/todo_dart_react.dart';\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  setClientConfiguration();\r\n\r\n  TodoActions actions = TodoActions();\r\n  TodoStore store = TodoStore(actions);\r\n\r\n  var todoApp = (TodoApp()\r\n    ..actions = actions\r\n    ..store = store)();\r\n\r\n  final container = querySelector('#app-container');\r\n  react_dom.render(todoApp, container);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe container previously mentioned is the DOM node with an `id` attribute value of `app-container` as shown below. You'll notice I've included [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to handle the styling our of UI components.\r\n\r\n```html:index.html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n  <head>\r\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge, chrome=1\" />\r\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\r\n    <meta\r\n      name=\"viewport\"\r\n      content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0\"\r\n    />\r\n\r\n    <title>Dart React Todo</title>\r\n    <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"favicon.ico\" type=\"image/x-icon\" />\r\n    <link\r\n      rel=\"stylesheet\"\r\n      href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/latest/css/bootstrap.min.css\"\r\n    />\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <div id=\"app-container\" class=\"container\"></div>\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"/packages/react/react.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"/packages/react/react_dom.js\"></script>\r\n    <script defer src=\"main.dart.js\"></script>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### /lib/src/\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at `actions.dart`. This file defines the available operations we can perform.\r\n\r\n```dart:actions.dart\r\nclass TodoActions {\r\n  final Action<Todo> addTodo = new Action<Todo>();\r\n  final Action<Todo> deleteTodo = new Action<Todo>();\r\n  final Action<Todo> completeTodo = new Action<Todo>();\r\n  final Action clearTodoList = new Action();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll notice some actions take a `Todo` parameter. Let's define the structure of our `Todo` model.\r\n\r\n```dart:todo.dart\r\nclass Todo {\r\n  String content;\r\n  bool completed = false;\r\n\r\n  Todo(this.content);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach `Todo` object can be initialized with some content and has a completed state which is initially `false`.\r\n\r\n### /stores/\r\n\r\nWe now have some actions to dispatch. Next, we need a store to contain our application's data. For this example, we only need one store.\r\n\r\n**Note**: For larger applications, you will generally have multiple stores. Review the w_flux [README](https://github.com/Workiva/w_flux) for more information.\r\n\r\n```dart:todo_store.dart\r\nclass TodoStore extends Store {\r\n  TodoStore(TodoActions actions) : _actions = actions {\r\n    _todos = [\r\n      new Todo('Learn Dart'),\r\n      new Todo('Learn React'),\r\n      new Todo('????'),\r\n      new Todo('Profit!')\r\n    ];\r\n\r\n    triggerOnAction(_actions.addTodo, (todo) => _todos.add(todo));\r\n    triggerOnAction(_actions.completeTodo, (todo) => todo.completed = true);\r\n    triggerOnAction(_actions.deleteTodo, (todo) => _todos.remove(todo));\r\n    triggerOnAction(_actions.clearTodoList, (_) => _todos = []);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  final TodoActions _actions;\r\n\r\n  List<Todo> _todos = [];\r\n  List<Todo> get todos => _todos;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen our `TodoStore` is constructed, it populates our todo list with some pre-defined `Todo` objects. It also connects our actions to the store using `triggerOnAction()`. This function will re-render all components that are watching the store after the action has completed. You'll also notice we have a public getter to obtain the list of todos.\r\n\r\nTo summarize so far, we have:\r\n\r\n- Initialized an entry point into the application\r\n- Defined actions for the todo list\r\n- Created a data model for a Todo item\r\n- Set up a store to contain the application's data\r\n\r\n### /views/\r\n\r\nThe final piece will be the OverReact UI components to display the store's data. We defined a top-level `TodoApp` component in `main.dart`. This is what we refer to as a [\"container\"](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0) component. It subscribes to our store and dispatches actions. It does _not_ handle displaying UI components.\r\n\r\n```dart:todo_app.dart\r\n@Factory()\r\nUiFactory<TodoAppProps> TodoApp = _$TodoApp;\r\n\r\n@Props()\r\nclass _$TodoAppProps extends FluxUiProps<TodoActions, TodoStore> {}\r\n\r\n@Component()\r\nclass TodoAppComponent extends FluxUiComponent<TodoAppProps> {\r\n  @override\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (TodoList()\r\n      ..addTodo = props.actions.addTodo\r\n      ..deleteTodo = props.actions.deleteTodo\r\n      ..todos = props.store.todos)();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** If the structure of this component is confusing, please review the [anatomy of an OverReact component.](https://github.com/Workiva/over_react#anatomy-of-an-overreact-component)\r\n\r\nThe `TodoList` component is a \"presentational\" component. It has no knowledge of any stores/actions and simply renders the data passed along as props and uses [callbacks](https://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html#presentational-and-container-components) to communicate with the store. Let's take a look at the `renderListItems()` function of the `TodoList` component.\r\n\r\n```dart:todo_list.dart\r\n/// Create a new [TodoListItem] for each todo.\r\nList _renderListItems() {\r\n  List items = [];\r\n\r\n  for (Todo todo in props.todos) {\r\n    items.add(\r\n      (TodoListItem()\r\n        ..key = todo.content\r\n        ..todo = todo\r\n        ..deleteTodo = props.deleteTodo)(),\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return items;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on the todo data passed in as props, this function creates a new list of `TodoListItem` components to be rendered. Those components will render as follows:\r\n\r\n```dart:todo_list_item.dart\r\nrender() {\r\n  return ListGroupItem()(\r\n    (Dom.input()\r\n      ..className = 'mr-3'\r\n      ..type = 'checkbox')(),\r\n    Dom.span()(\r\n      props.todo.content,\r\n    ),\r\n    (Button()\r\n      ..addTestId('deleteTodo')\r\n      ..className = 'float-right'\r\n      ..skin = ButtonSkin.DANGER\r\n      ..onClick = ((event) => props.deleteTodo(props.todo)))(\r\n      'Delete',\r\n    ),\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `ListGroupItem` component is taken from the [OverReact examples](https://github.com/Workiva/over_react/blob/master/web/src/demo_components/list_group_item.dart). It models the [list group component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/list-group/) from Bootstrap. You can find more OverReact example components located in [`lib/src/todo_dart_react/components`](https://github.com/leerob/dart-react-todo/tree/master/lib/src/todo_dart_react/components).\r\n\r\nYou'll notice we've added a test ID to the `Button` component using `..addTestId()`. Let's talk about how we can unit test this component.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAll of the test files are located in the `test/` directory. For this example, I've only created unit tests. You could also create integration and functional tests here as well. Testing OverReact components is simple using [over_react_test](https://github.com/Workiva/over_react_test). Let's look at how we can test our `TodoListItem` component to check it properly calls `deleteTodo` when the button is clicked.\r\n\r\n**todo_list_item_test.dart**\r\n\r\n```dart\r\ntest('calls deleteTodo when button is clicked', () {\r\n  bool called = false;\r\n  Todo todo = Todo('Testing!');\r\n  void handler(_) {\r\n    called = true;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // A TestJacket is returned from `mount`.\r\n  // The jacket instance exposes everything you might need to\r\n  // access things like the component's props, the DOM node it renders, the component instance itself, etc.\r\n  TestJacket<TodoListItemComponent> jacket = mount(TodoListItem()\r\n    ..deleteTodo = handler\r\n    ..todo = todo);\r\n\r\n  final deleteButtonNode = queryByTestId(jacket.getInstance(), 'deleteTodo');\r\n  click(deleteButtonNode);\r\n  expect(called, isTrue);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test creates a new handler for deleting a todo and passes it to the `TodoListItem` when rendering. Then, we can retrieve the delete button from the DOM of the rendered instance and simulate clicking the button. Finally, we can expect that the handler was successfully called.\r\n\r\n**Note:** We don't need to test what happens _when_ a todo is deleted here. For [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns), we should unit test that it is successfully removed from the store in `todo_store_test.dart`.\r\n\r\nWe can now run all unit tests using the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pub run build_runner test\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Continuous Integration\r\n\r\nContinuous Integration (CI) is the process of automating the building and testing of your code every time you commit changes to GitHub. We can utilize [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to easily perform static analysis, check formatting, run unit tests, and generate code coverage using a `.travis.yml` file. You don't need to worry about configuring this file - it's already all set up and running in this repository. If you [fork the repo](https://github.com/leerob/dart-react-todo#fork-destination-box) to create your own application, you will need to sync Travis CI with your GitHub account to trigger builds when you commit changes.\r\n\r\n### Deploying\r\n\r\nWhen you're ready to compile your code to JS, we can use `pub run build_runner build -r`.\r\nThe `-r` flag stands for \"release\" - and uses `dart2js` to compile Dart into a single JS bundle.\r\n\r\n`dart2js` will automatically remove any dead code or unused libraries. By default, the\r\ncompiled code is output to `.dart_tool`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pub run build_runner build -r\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Netlify\r\n\r\n[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) makes it extremely easy to deploy your compiled code. You can create an account for free and have the ability to upgrade to utilize features like custom domain names, SSL, and more. Let's look at how we can deploy our todo application from the command line.\r\n\r\n**Note**: This will create a `.netlify` file which you might want to commit for your application.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm install netlify-cli -g\r\n$ pub run build_runner build\r\n$ netlify deploy\r\n? No site id specified, create a new site Yes\r\n? Path to deploy? (current dir) build/web/\r\nDeploying folder: build/web/\r\n\r\nDeploy is live (permalink):\r\n  http://5a11de44a6188f59f422296f.goofy-colden-2480f1.netlify.com\r\n\r\nLast build is always accessible on http://goofy-colden-2480f1.netlify.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it! 🎉 We can modify the settings for our site on Netlify to change the site name. You can view the deployed todo app at https://dart-react-todo.netlify.com/.\r\n\r\n## Your Turn\r\n\r\nThe todo list isn't fully completed per our requirements. To fully finish the application, you'll need to:\r\n\r\n- Mark todos as completed when the checkbox is clicked\r\n- Add an action for clearing all completed todos\r\n- Modify the `TodoStore` to listen to the new action\r\n- Create the `TodoFooter` component\r\n- Hook up the buttons in the footer to the store\r\n- Use icons inside the buttons\r\n\r\nYou can view the entire source code [here](https://github.com/leerob/dart-react-todo).

Nothing too crazy.\r\n\r\nI've used CircleCI as my go-to provider for a while now. When I'm trying to get a project off the ground,\r\nI don't want to worry about reinventing the wheel every time I need to set up CI.\r\n\r\nGitHub recently came out with Actions, which appeared to solve the same problem without relying on an external service.\r\nThen, there was a security incident with CircleCI on August 31st.\r\nI decided to sign up for the beta of GitHub Actions and give it a shot.\r\n\r\n## CircleCI\r\n\r\nHere's the CircleCI config I was using. It installs the dependencies and runs `yarn test`.\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nversion: 2\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    docker:\r\n      - image: circleci/node:10.15.0\r\n    steps:\r\n      - checkout\r\n      - restore_cache:\r\n          name: Restoring dependencies\r\n          keys:\r\n            - dependencies-v1-{{ checksum \"yarn.lock\" }}\r\n      - run:\r\n          name: Installing dependencies\r\n          command: yarn\r\n      - save_cache:\r\n          name: Saving dependencies\r\n          paths:\r\n            - ~/.cache/yarn\r\n            - node_modules\r\n          key: dependencies-v1-{{ checksum \"yarn.lock\" }}\r\n      - run:\r\n          name: Running tests\r\n          command: yarn test\r\n```\r\n\r\n## GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n> GitHub Actions supports Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET, and more. Build, test, and deploy applications in your language of choice.\r\n\r\nI can achieve the **exact configuration** as CircleCI with GitHub Actions 🎉\r\n\r\n```yml:.github/workflows/workflow.yml\r\nname: CI\r\non: pull_request\r\njobs:\r\n  test:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    steps:\r\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v1\r\n        with:\r\n          fetch-depth: 1\r\n      - name: Setup Node.js\r\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v1\r\n        with:\r\n          node-version: 10.15.0\r\n      - name: Installing dependencies\r\n        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile\r\n      - name: Running tests\r\n        run: yarn test\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter adding this file at `.github/workflows/workflow.yml`, you'll be able to see each run show up under the \"Actions\" tab.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`GitHub Actions Tab`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/github-actions/actions-tab.png`}\r\n  width={1000}\r\n  height={548}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nI've defined my check to happen on every pull request.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`GitHub Actions Checks`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/github-actions/checks.png`}\r\n  width={1000}\r\n  height={444}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions has been excellent so far. Plus, there's a lot more I could do with Actions.\r\nYou can run a workflow on any GitHub event (e.g. push, issue creation, releases, etc) and even:\r\n\r\n- [Deploy to AWS/Kubernetes](https://github.com/actions/aws)\r\n- [Publish a package to NPM](https://github.com/actions/npm)\r\n- [Create a ticket in JIRA](https://github.com/atlassian/gajira)\r\n- [Label and close stale issues and pull requests](https://github.com/actions/stale)\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to seeing the adoption of GitHub Actions as it releases to the public.\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\n> In this series, you will learn how to [create a dashboard](/dashboard) using Next.js API routes and integrate with third-party APIs.\r\n\r\n<Analytics />\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nGoogle Analytics is, by far, the most popular analytics platform. In this post, we'll look at how\r\nwe can retrieve the number of page views in a specific time range programmatically.\r\n\r\nIf you're more concerned about privacy, you might consider using [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/ref/T93GOJ) or [SimpleAnalytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/).\r\n\r\n**Note:** You'll need to turn off your ad blocker for this page to work.\r\n\r\n## Getting Access to Google Analytics\r\n\r\nTo gain access to the Google Analytics API, you need to:\r\n\r\n- Go to the [Google Developer Console.](https://console.developers.google.com/)\r\n- Create a new project.\r\n- Credentials -> Create Credentials -> Service-account key.\r\n- Click \"Enable APIs and services.\"\r\n- Find \"Google Analytics API\" and enable it.\r\n\r\nSince we're communicating server-to-server, we'll need a [service account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount).\r\n\r\n- Go to your [service accounts](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page.\r\n- Create a service account.\r\n- Click \"Create Key\" and choose JSON.\r\n\r\nYou should now have a JSON file similar to this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"service_account\",\r\n  \"project_id\": \"...\",\r\n  \"private_key_id\": \"...\",\r\n  \"private_key\": \"...\",\r\n  \"client_email\": \"...\",\r\n  \"client_id\": \"...\",\r\n  \"auth_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\",\r\n  \"token_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token\",\r\n  \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs\",\r\n  \"client_x509_cert_url\": \"...\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe use this key later to set up our client in our API Route.\r\nOkay, back to the [service account](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).\r\nWe need to delegate [domain-wide authority](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#delegatingauthority).\r\n\r\n- On the table row, click Actions -> Edit.\r\n- Show Domain-Wide Delegation -> Enable G-Suite Domain-Wide Delegation.\r\n\r\nFinally, we need to add our service account email to the Google Analytics account we want to use.\r\n\r\n- Go to the Admin panel inside Google Analytics.\r\n- Click \"User Management.\"\r\n- Add the `client_email` from your service account.\r\n\r\n**That's it!** 🎉 You now have access to make requests to the Google Analytics API with your service account.\r\n\r\n## Creating an environment variable\r\n\r\nTo securely access the API, we need to include the secret with each request.\r\nWe also _do not_ want to commit secrets to git. Thus, we should use an environment variable.\r\n\r\nSince I'm deploying with [Vercel](https://vercel.com), I can add the secrets via their CLI.\r\nWe only need a few of the values from the JSON file. For the private key, make sure you convert\r\nthe new line characters (`\\n`) to actual new lines.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ vc secret add -- google-private-key \"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\r\nMIIEvQIBA\r\n..\r\n..\r\n2DAVOW4c=\r\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\"\r\n$ vc secret add google-client-email my-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com\r\n$ vc secret add google-client-id 721877721877\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo reference these values locally when using `vc dev`, they need to be added to your `.env` file.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nGOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=\"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\nDVOW4c=\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n\"\r\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=my-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we need to add the secrets to our `vercel.json`.\r\n\r\n```json:vercel.json\r\n{\r\n  \"env\": {\r\n    \"GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY\": \"@google-private-key\",\r\n    \"GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL\": \"@google-client-email\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can now reference the secrets via `process.env.GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` in our API route.\r\n\r\n**Note:** If you have a lot of environment variables in Vercel, you might need to [encrypt your service account](https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-do-i-workaround-vercel-s-4-kb-environment-variables-limit).\r\n\r\n## Creating the API Route\r\n\r\nLet's start by creating a new API route at `pages/api/page-views.js`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default (req, res) => {\r\n  return res.status(200).json({});\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make server-side requests to Google Analytics, we can install the [googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client) library.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ yarn add googleapis@48.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we can initialize `googleapis` inside our API route.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { google } from 'googleapis';\r\n\r\nlet googleAuth;\r\n\r\nexport default async (_, res) => {\r\n  googleAuth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({\r\n    credentials: {\r\n      client_email: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL,\r\n      private_key: process.env.GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY\r\n    },\r\n    scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly']\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  const analytics = google.analytics({\r\n    auth,\r\n    version: 'v3'\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return res.status(200).json({});\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we want to pull statistics about our site. We'd like to know the total number of views for a given time range.\r\nTo allow the API route to be re-used, let's pass the start date as a query parameter.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst startDate = req.query.startDate;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we can use the same API route to fetch stats about different time ranges.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { google } from 'googleapis';\r\n\r\nlet googleAuth;\r\n\r\nexport default async (_, res) => {\r\n  googleAuth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({\r\n    credentials: {\r\n      client_email: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL,\r\n      private_key: process.env.GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY\r\n    },\r\n    scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly']\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  const analytics = google.analytics({\r\n    auth,\r\n    version: 'v3'\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  const startDate = req.query.startDate;\r\n  const response = await analytics.data.ga.get({\r\n    'end-date': 'today',\r\n    ids: 'ga:186371021',\r\n    metrics: 'ga:pageviews',\r\n    'start-date': startDate\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return res.status(200).json({\r\n    pageViews: response.data.rows[0][0]\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n_Bonus_: You can cache the API route with the [cache-control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) header.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nCache-Control: public, max-age=120, stale-while-revalidate=60\r\n```\r\n\r\n<Analytics />\r\n\r\n## Keep Reading\r\n\r\n**Create a Dashboard with Next.js API Routes**\r\n\r\n- Part 1 - [Unsplash API](/blog/unsplash-api-nextjs)\r\n- Part 2 - [YouTube API](/blog/youtube-api-nextjs)\r\n- Part 3 - [Google Analytics API](/blog/google-analytics-api-nextjs)\r\n- Part 4 - [Fetching Data with SWR](/blog/fetching-data-with-swr)\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\nData is a beautiful thing. Especially when we can sort, organize, and manipulate it to our needs. In this post, I’m going to walk you through harnessing the power of the Google Places, Yelp, and Foursquare APIs to create a list of businesses in your area.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nLet’s create a Business model to represent the data we’ll retrieve from our sources. Most of the parameters to create a Business are pretty straight forward. If you’re comparing businesses between data sources, you’ll find that the naming conventions aren’t equal. To alleviate this issue, you can use the address as a constant between the businesses. You could also add other attributes to suit your needs, like a phone number or website link.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Business:\r\n  def __init__(self, name, address, rating,\r\n\t\t\t   rating_count, checkin_count):\r\n\tself.name = name\r\n\tself.address = address\r\n\tself.rating = rating\r\n\tself.rating_count = rating_count\r\n\tself.checkin_count = checkin_count\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe’ll be using the urllib2 library to make HTTP requests. Let’s create a helper function to reduce repeated code.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef make_request(url):\r\n\twith closing(urlopen(url)) as response:\r\n\t\treturn json.loads(response.read())\r\nreturn data\r\n```\r\n\r\nI’ll be focusing on explaining code snippets in the following section. If you’d like to jump straight to the completed code, here’s the [link](https://github.com/leerob/Guesstimator).\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef make_request(url):\r\n\twith closing(urlopen(url)) as response:\r\n\t\treturn json.loads(response.read())\r\nreturn data\r\n```\r\n\r\n## APIs\r\n\r\n### Foursquare\r\n\r\nBefore diving in, we must first obtain our client keys to access the [API](https://developer.foursquare.com/). You can find those [here](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/) after creating an application. Next, let’s look at the different endpoints we can access. The [explore](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/explore) endpoint allows us to find venues around a given location. This endpoint contains venue rating information as well as check-in counts.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nhttps://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet’s give it some parameters to narrow our search:\r\n\r\n- ll: Latitude and longitude of the user’s location.\r\n- radius: Search radius in meters.\r\n- categoryId: Limit results to a specific category (e.g. “bars”).\r\n\r\nCombining these parameters with our client keys, we can make a request to our newly created URL and retrieve a list of venues:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nvenue_list = []\r\ntry:\r\n\tdata = make_request(url)\r\nfor item in data['response']['groups'][0]['items']:\r\n\tvenue = item['venue']\r\n\tvenue_list.append(Business(\r\n\t\tvenue['name'],\r\n\t\tvenue['location']['address'],\r\n\t\tvenue['rating'],\r\n\t\tvenue['ratingSignals'],\r\n\t\tvenue['stats']['checkinsCount']))\r\nexcept Exception, e:\r\n\tprint e\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter receiving our JSON response, we can iterate through the dictionary to create our array of Business objects containing our desired information.\r\n\r\n### Yelp\r\n\r\nFollowing suite with Foursquare, we must first obtain our consumer keys before we can access the [API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview). You can find those [here](https://www.yelp.com/login?return_url=%2Fdevelopers%2Fmanage_api_keys) after logging in. I tried to refrain from using [external libraries](https://github.com/yelp/yelp-python) to reduce installation requirements, but ultimately ended up needing [rauth](https://rauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\r\nTo install simply run:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npip install rauth\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe’ll be using the [Search API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api) to obtain a list of businesses in our area.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nhttps://api.yelp.com/v2/search\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce again, let’s give the URL some parameters to narrow our search:\r\n\r\n- ll: Latitude and longitude of the user’s location.\r\n- radius_filter: Search radius in meters. Max distance 40000 meters.\r\n- term: Limit results to a specific category (e.g. “bars”).\r\n\r\nTo obtain our desired information, we first need to create an authenticated session. Next, we make a request to our newly created URL and once again parse the JSON response.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsession = rauth.OAuth1Session(\r\n\tconsumer_key = CONSUMER_KEY,\r\n\tconsumer_secret = CONSUMER_SECRET,\r\n\taccess_token = TOKEN,\r\n\taccess_token_secret = TOKEN_SECRET)\r\n\r\nrequest = session.get(url, params=params)\r\ndata = request.json()\r\nsession.close()\r\nbusiness_list = []\r\nfor business in data['businesses']:\r\n\taddress = business['location']['display_address'][0]\r\n\tbusiness_list.append(Business(\r\n\t\tbusiness['name'],\r\n\t\taddress,\r\n\t\tbusiness['rating'],\r\n\t\tbusiness['review_count'],\r\n\t\t'N/A'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Google Places\r\n\r\nYou’ve got the hang of this now, right? Obtain the [keys](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key), read the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/places/), and find our [endpoint](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search).\r\n\r\n```python\r\npip install rauth\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe’ll be using the [Search API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search) to obtain a list of businesses in our area.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?params\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe need to supply these parameters:\r\n\r\n- location: Latitude and longitude of the user’s location.\r\n- radius: Search radius in meters. Max distance 50000 meters.\r\n- type: Limit results to a specific category (e.g. “bars”).\r\n\r\n```python\r\nplace_list = []\r\ntry:\r\n\tdata = make_request(url)\r\n\tfor result in data['results']:\r\n\t\tplace = search_google_place(result['place_id'])\r\n\t\tplace_list.append(place)\r\nexcept Exception, e:\r\n  print e\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe’ll need to make a request to an individual place using a new URL.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json?placeid=id\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we’ll once again parse the JSON result and retrieve the places.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n\tdata = make_request(url)\r\n\tplace = data['result']\r\n\treturn Business(\r\n\t\tplace['name'],\r\n\t\tplace['formatted_address'].split(',')[0],\r\n\t\tplace['rating'],\r\n\t\tplace['user_ratings_total'],\r\n\t\t'N/A')\r\nexcept Exception, e:\r\n  print e\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Congratulations! You’ve successfully retrieved all your local businesses from Foursquare, Yelp and Google.\r\n\r\nNow that you’ve obtained a list of Business objects, you’re free to manipulate the data as you please. I chose to leverage the ratings to create a better ranking system for bars in my area, but the possibilities are endless.

      "raw": "\r\nAPIs are the backbone of Hy-Vee.\r\n\r\nProducts, locations, lists, coupons - the data sources that power our company are all powered through APIs.\r\n\r\nWe’ve traditionally used a [RESTful](https://restfulapi.net/) approach to creating APIs. Over the past 6 months, we’ve adopted [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) for every new microservice API we create.\r\n\r\nWhy? Let’s find out.\r\n\r\n## What is GraphQL?\r\n\r\n> GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine, but is instead backed by your existing code and data.\r\n\r\nLet’s unpack that a bit. It’s an open-source [specification](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/) for how to query your APIs. It’s language/framework agnostic, which means it works with almost every language you can imagine.\r\n\r\nSimply put, **GraphQL makes it easier for us to create performant, scalable APIs.**\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Hy-Vee Aisles Online Mobile App`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/graphql-at-hy-vee/app.png`}\r\n  width={1200}\r\n  height={600}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## What Problem Are We Trying to Solve?\r\n\r\nA few months ago, we launched our new Aisles Online mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hy-vee-aisles-online/id1401371704) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hyvee.grocery&hl=en_US)). In the process of evaluating which tech to use, we identified a major requirement:\r\n\r\n**The application needed to be blazing fast. Pages should load quickly and interactions should appear to happen in near real-time.**\r\n\r\nWhen our home screen loads, it needs to retrieve data from a variety of places. This would typically require a handful of API calls. This can be slow.\r\n\r\nEnter GraphQL. With a single query, we can fetch data about our customer, products, locations, and more. It’s blazing fast. Plus, we can utilize [Optimistic UI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/features/optimistic-ui/) to make interactions feel instantaneous.\r\n\r\n## Fetching Data\r\n\r\nLet’s say we’re dealing with a user’s shopping lists. When our page loads, we want to load all of the users' lists.\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\nquery {\r\n  lists {\r\n    listId\r\n    name\r\n    isPrimary\r\n    lastModified\r\n    listItems {\r\n      isChecked\r\n      listItemId\r\n      productId\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis request will only fetch what is needed. The response conforms to the same structure as the query and returns a JSON object.\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"lists\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"listId\": \"d2bf5976-c4e0-4e4a-833a-8bc32549aeff\",\r\n        \"name\": \"My List\",\r\n        \"isPrimary\": true,\r\n        \"lastModified\": \"2019-09-09T20:03:55.607Z\",\r\n        \"listItems\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"isChecked\": false,\r\n            \"listItemId\": \"69381a3c-89fe-4f42-a14e-8da955aa9dce\",\r\n            \"productId\": 123\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of other options available on the list model we can add or remove as necessary. GraphQL will only return what we explicitly asked for.\r\n\r\n## Modifying Data\r\n\r\nIf fetching is the equivalent of a GET request, a [Mutation](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/) is the equivalent of a PUT or POST request. Here’s a simple example of how we might create a new shopping list.\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\nmutation {\r\n  createList(\r\n    createListInput: {\r\n      listId: \"415cefed-1624-4977-96c3-f835ad2369d4\"\r\n      name: \"Snacks\"\r\n      created: \"2018-10-05T14:48:00.000Z\"\r\n      lastModified: \"2018-10-05T14:48:00.000Z\"\r\n      isPrimary: false\r\n      isRemoved: false\r\n    }\r\n  ) {\r\n    listId\r\n    name\r\n    isPrimary\r\n    lastModified\r\n    listItems {\r\n      listItemId\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf successful, this mutation will return a JSON response of the fields we’ve defined above.\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"createList\": {\r\n      \"listId\": \"415cefed-1624-4977-96c3-f835ad2369d4\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Snacks\",\r\n      \"isPrimary\": false,\r\n      \"lastModified\": \"2018-10-05T14:48:00.000Z\",\r\n      \"listItems\": []\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## GraphQL API\r\n\r\nAs the number of our microservice APIs began to grow, we recognized a problem. We had followed best practices for creating APIs with a [single responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), but this meant we had multiple entry points to retrieve data. Clients had to stitch together resources from each of these APIs to paint the full picture. There had to be a [better way](https://principledgraphql.com/).\r\n\r\nEnter the GraphQL API. Unlike our other APIs, the **GraphQL API is not backed by a database.** This API acts as a proxy between all of our other services, providing one unified schema. This led to an improved developer experience for our consumers and the ability to easily stitch together pieces of information across multiple APIs. We currently have almost 10 different graphs being combined into one simple interface for developers.\r\n\r\nWith the GraphQL API, we can easily link a list item to a product, which is a completely separate API. Since the list item contains a `productId`, we can make a query to fetch the product.\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\nquery {\r\n  product(productId: $productId) {\r\n    productId\r\n    productImages(where: { isPrimary: true, size: $size }) {\r\n      size\r\n      uri\r\n      isPrimary\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows us to retrieve the associated product image for the list item.\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\n{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"product\": {\r\n      \"productId\": \"37191\",\r\n      \"productImages\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"size\": \"THUMBNAIL\",\r\n          \"uri\": \"https://example.com/image-123.jpg\",\r\n          \"isPrimary\": true\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo achieve the GraphQL API, we’re using a custom solution - but it’s similar to the idea behind [Apollo Federation](https://blog.apollographql.com/apollo-federation-f260cf525d21).\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { ApolloGateway } = require('@apollo/gateway');\r\n\r\nconst gateway = new ApolloGateway({\r\n  serviceList: [\r\n    { name: 'accounts', url: 'accounts-api.company.com/graphql' },\r\n    { name: 'reviews', url: 'reviews-api.company.com/graphql' },\r\n    { name: 'products', url: 'products-api.company.com/graphql' },\r\n    { name: 'inventory', url: 'inventory-api.company.com/graphql' }\r\n  ]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Consuming Our APIs\r\n\r\nAll new web applications at Hy-Vee are being created with [React](https://reactjs.org/). For our mobile applications, this means [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). Thus, we needed a solution that would work across both web and mobile to consume GraphQL.\r\n\r\n[Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) is a complete state management library for JavaScript apps. Write a GraphQL query and Apollo Client will take care of requesting and caching your data, as well as updating your UI.\r\n\r\nThe `useQuery` [hook](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-hooks/) provides a concise way to query your APIs.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction Lists() {\r\n  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_LISTS);\r\n\r\n  if (loading) return 'Loading...';\r\n  if (error) return `Error! ${error.message}`;\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <ul>\r\n      {data.lists.map((list) => (\r\n        <li key={list.listId}>{list.name}</li>\r\n      ))}\r\n    </ul>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nAdopting GraphQL has been a huge win for developer productivity and ultimately our user experience.\r\n\r\nCommon issues like [batching requests](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) and [caching](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/advanced/caching/) have already been solved through the amazing open-source community around GraphQL. We’ve even started experimenting with TypeScript and [auto-generating types](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling) based on our GraphQL schemas.\r\n\r\nGraphQL at Hy-Vee is here to stay — and it’s only getting better 🚀\r\n",

    "image": "/static/images/gumroad-node-api/banner.jpg",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\r\nWhile exploring the [Gumroad API](https://gumroad.com/api) for my [personal dashboard](/dashboard),\r\nI struggled to find any examples using Node.js. Yes, there was a cURL example.\r\n\r\n```http\r\ncurl https://api.gumroad.com/v2/products/sDpG \\\r\n  -d \"access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\\r\n  -X GET\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, [converting that](https://kigiri.github.io/fetch/) into a `fetch` was not working as I'd expect.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfetch('https://api.gumroad.com/v2/products/sDpG', {\r\n  body: 'access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN',\r\n  headers: {\r\n    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'\r\n  },\r\n  method: 'POST'\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, I was getting a `404` because it was expecting a `GET` instead of `POST`.\r\nThen, I got a `401` since the authorization was incorrect. After a bit of fumbling,\r\nI was able to get the Gumroad API working with Node.js. Here's an example fetching\r\ninformation about a specific product.\r\n\r\n```js:pages/api/gumroad.js\r\nexport default async (_, res) => {\r\n  const API_KEY = process.env.GUMROAD_API_KEY;\r\n  const response = await fetch(`https://api.gumroad.com/v2/products/sDpG`, {\r\n    headers: {\r\n      Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,\r\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json'\r\n    },\r\n    method: 'GET'\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  const { product } = await response.json();\r\n  const sales = product.sales_usd_cents / 100;\r\n\r\n  return res.status(200).json({ sales });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's another example fetching all of the sales for a user.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet url = '/v2/sales';\r\nconst allSales = [];\r\nconst API_KEY = process.env.GUMROAD_API_KEY;\r\n\r\nwhile (url) {\r\n  const response = await fetch(`https://api.gumroad.com${url}`, {\r\n    headers: {\r\n      Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,\r\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json'\r\n    },\r\n    method: 'GET'\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  const { sales, next_page_url: nextPageUrl } = await response.json();\r\n\r\n  allSales.push(sales);\r\n\r\n  if (nextPageUrl) {\r\n    url = nextPageUrl;\r\n  } else {\r\n    break;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nreturn res.status(200).json({ sales: allSales });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first example allowed me to fetch my total sales and display it on my dashboard.

      "raw": "\r\nI've realized there are many parallels between developers arguing on Twitter and rappers starting beef and writing diss tracks. This post is a lighthearted analogy to talk about what works and what doesn't when using Twitter as an advocate.\r\n\r\nLet's dive into our case study: **Drizzy Drake**.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Drake dancing from hotline bling`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/dev-twitter/drake.gif`}\r\n  width={480}\r\n  height={270}\r\n  priority\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Why Drake?\r\n\r\n[Drake](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)>) is an incredibly popular musician. He used to be on [Degrassi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrassi) for those who are older than 25. He \"[started from the bottom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RubBzkZzpUA)\" and now is here, quite literally becoming one of the [biggest artists in the world](https://www.vogue.co.uk/arts-and-lifestyle/article/drake-worlds-biggest-pop-star).\r\n\r\nIn his rise to fame, he's had _a lot_ of haters. People who say he's terrible at singing and should stick to rapping. People who say he's a terrible rapper. And everything else in between. But he's remained strong. As our queen Nicki said:\r\n\r\n<Callout emoji=\"📣\">\r\n  Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me. – Nicki Minaj (Moment\r\n  4 Life)\r\n</Callout>\r\n\r\n## How does Drake handle rap beef?\r\n\r\nSince Drake is on top of the rap game, naturally other rappers want to take him down. They come after him and start drama (\"rap beef\") and create buzz in the media. This allows them to leech off of Drake's popularity and influence to give them _free promo_.\r\n\r\n**But it only works if Drake plays the game.**\r\n\r\nYou'll see many rappers talking about \"no free promo\". Why? Because it's not worth it to answer these up-and-coming rappers and give them air time, putting eyes on _their_ music. What can developers and those in DevRel learn from this?\r\n\r\n<Callout emoji=\"💡\">\r\n\r\n**Lesson #1:** Don't let people use you to draw eyes to their content. You don't always need to respond.\r\n\r\n</Callout>\r\n\r\nWhen _do_ you respond, though?\r\n\r\n## Case Study: RIP Meek Mill\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, rapper [Meek Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meek_Mill) started a rap beef with Drake. He said that Drake didn't write his own raps. Drake didn't take this claim lightly, as it's equivalent to saying your software product is [selling snake oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil). So, Drake decided it was time to fire back.\r\n\r\nHe dropped a diss track, which led Meek Mill to keep subtweeting him.\r\n\r\n<ImageWithTheme\r\n  alt={`Meek mills deleted tweets`}\r\n  light={`/static/images/dev-twitter/meek.png`}\r\n  dark={`/static/images/dev-twitter/meek-dark.png`}\r\n  width={1876 / 2}\r\n  height={604 / 2}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nDrake _didn't even wait_ for Meek Mill to respond with an actual song, which is what typically happens in these types of beef. Instead, he dropped another song called [Back 2 Back](https://soundcloud.com/octobersveryown/drake-back-to-back-freestyle).\r\n\r\n<Callout emoji=\"📣\">\r\n  Trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers – Drake (Back 2 Back)\r\n</Callout>\r\n\r\n> _Side note: \"Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?\" was a lethal diss because Meek Mill was dating Nicki Minaj at the time. He was \"bodied\" as the kids say._\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Drake won the beef. So much so that Back 2 Back was **[literally nominated for a Grammy](https://www.complex.com/music/2015/12/drake-back-to-back-first-grammy-nominated-diss-song)**. He basically destroyed Meek Mills rap career for a while. It was brutal.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Drake clapping`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/dev-twitter/drake2.gif`}\r\n  width={325}\r\n  height={322}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<Callout emoji=\"💡\">\r\n\r\n**Lesson #2:** It makes sense to reply when information is clearly incorrect and your audience would benefit from setting the record straight.\r\n\r\n</Callout>\r\n\r\n> However, one big difference is rappers are aggressive with the insults, burns, and shots being fired. That's not the approach I'd recommend for everyone else, of course. Instead, **stay positive** and stick to the facts.\r\n\r\n## Case Study: Pusha T\r\n\r\nPusha T exposed to the world that Drake had a kid. His diss track towards Drake was called [The Story of Adidon](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/31/17408862/pusha-t-drake-duppy-diss-beef-explained).\r\n\r\nHow did Drake handle it? [**He admitted he was wrong**](https://genius.com/a/drake-admits-to-having-a-secret-child-on-his-new-album-scorpion).\r\n\r\n<Callout emoji=\"📣\">\r\n  I wasn't hiding my kid from the world / I was hiding the world from my kid. –\r\n  Drake (Scorpion)\r\n</Callout>\r\n\r\nOkay, but what does that mean for developer twitter?\r\n\r\n<Callout emoji=\"💡\">\r\n\r\n**Lesson #3:** It's okay to admit when you're wrong. Own up to it. Everyone makes mistakes, and if your say something on Twitter that's wrong, have the humility to own it and correct yourself.\r\n\r\n</Callout>\r\n\r\n## 2AM on the Timeline\r\n\r\nI enjoyed writing this, hopefully you found it helpful. There's not as much content out there for Developer Advocates, or those in DevRel, who are typically in these type of situations. However, I'd say this applies to really all developers discussing nuanced topics on Twitter.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\n- Don't let people use you to draw eyes to their content. You don't always need to respond.\r\n- It makes sense to reply when information is clearly incorrect and your audience would benefit from setting the record straight.\r\n- It's okay to admit when you're wrong. Own up to it. Everyone makes mistakes, and if your say something on Twitter that's wrong, have the humility to own it and correct yourself.\r\n",

Today, I'm excited to announce **I've been** **promoted to Head of Developer Relations at Vercel**. I want to share how I got here, my plans for the future, and invite you to [join the team](https://vercel.com/careers).\r\n\r\n## My Path Towards Developer Relations\r\n\r\nI've always enjoyed the intersection of design, development, product management, marketing, and even sales. It stems from entrepreneurial roots. However, this desire to work across many parts of the business often came across as indecisiveness in my career.\r\n\r\nThat was three years ago – around the same time I began using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I didn't know what [Developer Relations](https://emilyfreeman.io/blog/developer-relations-more-than-the-art-of-talking-good) was at the time. However, I did know I wanted to create. I wanted to write, record, stream, post, tweet, and grow a community. I wanted to help others learn and progress in their careers. This realization led to me becoming a creator and helping others learn to program.\r\n\r\nAfter teaching over 100,000 developers from around the world, I joined the team at Vercel.\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1303849673141243905\" />\r\n\r\n## It’s all about community. In realtime.\r\n\r\nAt Vercel, we're [relentlessly focused](https://rauchg.com/2020/next-for-vercel#frontend-focus) on improving the Developer Experience of building for the web. This means changes like making `next dev` [start 24% faster](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10-2), refreshing changes [200ms quicker](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10-1), and including [zero-config solutions](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10) to improve performance.\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1387420270646943746\" />\r\n\r\nWe want to make development a [collaborative, real-time experience](https://twitter.com/shuding_/status/1378086219708473344) accessible to everyone. By providing close integrations to your [database](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1351576575888797696), CMS, or other services, we aim to make it as easy as possible to build modern web apps.\r\n\r\nNext.js is growing quickly with over [1.3 million installations per week](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next). Recent releases [10.0](http://nextjs.org/10), [10.1](https://nextjs.org/10-1), and [10.2](https://nextjs.org/10-2) have added features to help improve performance, while simplifying and speeding up the development process. **But we're just getting started.**\r\n\r\nYesterday, we announced a special edition of [Next.js Conf](https://nextjs.org/conf) on June 15th, where we'll be unveiling some new features you don't want to miss. If you were one of the 40,000 attendees last year, you'll have the option to select an exclusive silver ticket. There's also one more VIP gold ticket which I won't explain just yet 🤐\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1394749422194528263\" />\r\n\r\n## Join Me\r\n\r\nI'm equally excited to announce we're growing our team with three roles:\r\n\r\n- [Developer Advocate](https://vercel.com/careers) – Educate on the latest Next.js features, craft high-quality examples and demos, engage with our community, write documentation, and advocate for a faster web.

      "raw": "\r\nHeroku made it easy for any developer to build and run applications in the cloud without managing their own infrastructure. Now 15 years later, it continues to inspire the next generation of developers. Why did Heroku become so popular? What can we learn from their incredible developer experience? How is Heroku shaping the next generation of serverless?\r\n\r\n## Early Days of Heroku\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) [launched EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2006/08/24/announcing-amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-amazon-ec2---beta/), making it easy to run compute on-demand. Developers didn't need to purchase, set up, and manage their own infrastructure anymore – they could pay for cloud compute as needed.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, many developers were building monolithic [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) applications. Rails made developers incredibly productive at building applications, but it was still painful and time-consuming to get them deployed. Developers might spend weeks (or months) just on deployment.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, three Ruby developers – James Lindenbaum, Adam Wiggins, and Orion Henry – founded Heroku. Their mission was to make computing more accessible. The [first version of Heroku](https://techcrunch.com/2008/02/07/heroku-lifts-ruby-on-rails-development-to-the-cloud/) was an in-browser code editor that made it easy to build and deploy Ruby applications.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt=\"Heroku's original product, an in-browser IDE allowing you to instantly create and publish Rails apps.\"\r\n  src={`/static/images/heroku/ide.png`}\r\n  width={833}\r\n  height={623}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nWhile their original goal was to help educate developers and make computing more accessible, they noticed that many developers weren't using the platform for _learning_ – they were using it as an easy way to get their Ruby applications deployed. Heroku joined Y Combinator to become the easiest place to build and deploy any Rails application.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt=\"Early version of Heroku from 2008, soon after joining Y Combinator.\"\r\n  src={`/static/images/heroku/2008.png`}\r\n  width={3014 / 2}\r\n  height={1586 / 2}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nShortly after Heroku launched, Google App Engine (2008) and Microsoft Azure (2010) entered the market. A trend started to appear. Developers wanted to spend less time configuring infrastructure, and more time building their application.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Heroku was bought by Salesforce for [$212 million](https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/08/breaking-salesforce-buys-heroku-for-212-million-in-cash/). At the time of acquisition, Heroku had ~30 employees and only supported Ruby. Y Combinator was still relatively unproven and Heroku was their [largest exit yet](https://www.ycdb.co/top-companies/exit-value).\r\n\r\nWhat did Salesforce see in Heroku that led to acquisition?\r\n\r\n## Early Bets\r\n\r\nHeroku made some early tech choices that proved to be very productive for developers building monolithic applications: **Ruby on Rails, Git, and Postgres.**\r\n\r\nGit was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds to help develop Linux. Even though there were many version control systems at the time, git begun to slowly grow in popularity. However, everything changed when GitHub was founded in 2007.\r\n\r\nLike the Heroku founders, the GitHub founders were Ruby developers. In 2008, the Ruby on Rails project switched to using GitHub, and the entire Ruby community followed shortly after (thus adopting git as well). **Heroku became synonymous with Rails.** Later, the creator of Ruby [joined Heroku](https://blog.heroku.com/matz_joins_heroku) to continue working on the language.\r\n\r\nTo run your Rails application, you needed a database. Heroku allowed you to add a Postgres database with **one click** through [add-ons](https://elements.heroku.com/addons). Today, Postgres has grown to be one of the most popular databases, which wasn't as obvious in 2008. It became the default choice for folks building monolithic Rails applications.\r\n\r\n<Callout emoji=\"💡\">\r\n\r\nAdam, the Co-Founder and CTO of Heroku, coined the term [12 factor app](https://12factor.net/). This was the blueprint for building for the web (at the time) and is still relevant many years later.\r\n\r\n</Callout>\r\n\r\n## Developer Productivity\r\n\r\nHeroku set a new standard for developer experience. To deploy your application, you pushed code to git and received a URL. `git push heroku main`. **That's it.**\r\n\r\nHeroku would build your application remotely (in the cloud) and deploy it to their infrastructure. Developers weren't used to deployment being this easy or fast. Heroku was ahead of its time and “serverless” in the sense you didn't have to manage servers yourself.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt=\"Heroku's landing page in 2011 after expanding past Ruby to become a cloud application platform\"\r\n  src={`/static/images/heroku/2011.png`}\r\n  width={3010 / 2}\r\n  height={1582 / 2}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nDevelopers were able to delegate hosting to the Heroku platform without feeling like they were giving up too much control. They didn't _want_ to manage server maintenance or perform upgrades – but they did want to understand what was happening if things went wrong.\r\n\r\n<Callout emoji=\"💡\">\r\n\r\nHeroku's [Buildpacks](https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks) have shaped how software is built today. They automated the build process for any language or framework and transformed the code you write into a deployable image on Heroku. You might hear similar terminology today as “builders” or “adapters”.\r\n\r\n</Callout>\r\n\r\nAs their Co-Founder James said, you “[dialed up the knob when you wanted to scale up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FhcROr0XdM)”. Heroku nailed the CLI experience with commands like:\r\n\r\n- `heroku logs` - View realtime logs from your application\r\n- `heroku run` - Execute any shell command on the remote machine\r\n- `heroku ps` - View the status of remote processes running\r\n- `heroku config:add key=value` - Add environment variables to configure your app\r\n- `heroku rollback` - Single command rollback to an existing working version\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt=\"Heroku's landing page in 2011 after expanding past Ruby to become a cloud application platform\"\r\n  src={`/static/images/heroku/platform.png`}\r\n  width={1141}\r\n  height={602}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Heroku's Platform Dominance\r\n\r\nHeroku became one of the largest platforms for building and deploying code by providing:\r\n\r\n- Hosting for your app\r\n- One-click button to add a database (including backups)\r\n- One-click resizing/scaling of services\r\n- Support for background jobs\r\n- Add-ons for monitoring, logging, and more\r\n\r\nDevelopers didn't need to manually configure services to get started. They just pushed code through git. And while Heroku was opinionated about it's preferred stack (Rails + Postgres), it had a wide ecosystems of add-ons if you had different preferences.\r\n\r\nThe seamless integration between the framework of choice (Ruby on Rails) and the infrastructure made developers incredibly productive. Developers could deploy a monolithic Rails app to Heroku in a weekend and dial up the knobs as their traffic increased.\r\n\r\nHeroku became a focal point of education for anyone working with Rails and Node.js due to its free tier. Hobby developers and students could turn their ideas into production code extremely fast, without needing access to a credit card.\r\n\r\n## From Monolith to Microservices\r\n\r\nDuring Heroku's rise to dominance, some developers began to scale out of monolithic workloads. This was expedited by two trends: **serverless** and **Kubernetes**.\r\n\r\n- **2013:** Docker is released\r\n- **2014:** Kubernetes is released\r\n- **2014:** AWS Lambda is released\r\n- **2017:** GitHub moves to Kubernetes\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt=\"Serverless and Kurbernetes trends on Google\"\r\n  src={`/static/images/heroku/trends.png`}\r\n  width={2360 / 2}\r\n  height={1254 / 2}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nDuring this same time period, the types of web experiences developers were trying to build demanded more specialized tools. There was an unbundling of the monolithic into dedicated, specialized services:\r\n\r\n| Monolith (on a single server) | Microservices (APIs & libraries)                                 |\r\n| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| Authentication                | Auth0, AWS Cognito                                               |\r\n| Database Queries              | Prisma, Mongoose                                                 |\r\n| Compute                       | AWS Lambda, Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, Cloudflare Workers |\r\n| HTML Rendering & Templates    | Frontend Frameworks                                              |\r\n| JavaScript and CSS Bundling   | Frontend Frameworks                                              |\r\n| Realtime                      | Firebase, Ably, Pusher, AWS SQS, etc.                            |\r\n| Storage                       | AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage                                     |\r\n| Image Optimization            | Imgix, Cloudinary, AWS CloudFront                                |\r\n\r\nAt the time, monolithic apps were still the fastest way for developers to put an idea into production. This new wave of serverless and Kubernetes was often difficult to use and required specialized talent. Some teams jumped on the new trend too quickly, where it was often cheaper to scale up and pay for a managed platform like Heroku than to hire a team of DevOps engineers.\r\n\r\nHowever, some developers were still ejecting from monolithic platforms due to cost, flexibility, or availability. And the state of tooling for serverless and Kubernetes left a lot to be desired. This lead to a _new wave of innovation_.\r\n\r\n## Serverless 1.0\r\n\r\nWhy did some developers start to explore moving from their monolith to serverless?\r\n\r\n- **Container size:** As the size of your application grew, so did your container – often requiring a more expensive Dyno (container) to run on Heroku. Developers wanted to break their monolith into smaller, lightweight, stateless functions. This made even more sense as code-splitting became automatic in frontend tooling like webpack (and Next.js) where you would only invoke the compute necessary for the requested route, as well as only loading the minimum required JavaScript.\r\n- **Difficulty scaling:** While turning up the knobs works for some applications, it's difficult to apply that approach to all apps. For example, what happens when your container has background tasks? How do you dial up the knob? Certain types of application architecture did not evolve well with monoliths. Built-in autoscaling is also [not available on all plans on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scaling#autoscaling).\r\n- **Issues with state:** Containers required complex health checks to understand when they were entering a bad state, often requiring restarts. This could get messy if there was initialization logic to connect to external services.\r\n- **Distributed visitors:** Heroku is _not_ an Edge Network and instead required you to bring your own CDN. This led some teams back to DevOps, often building their own internal version of Heroku (but with a container orchestration system like Kubernetes). Further, Heroku's limited region options meant it was a non-starter for teams with specific regulatory requirements around data storage.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you need to build a backend for a mobile app. Should you use a monolith or serverless? You want it to be scalable, stateless, and available around the world, all without spending too much money or time managing infrastructure.\r\n\r\n[Bret Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Taylor), the Co-CEO of Salesforce, co-creator of Google Maps, and former CTO of Facebook, was in this same position in 2019. He built an [iOS app](https://twitter.com/btaylor/status/1315312482894835712) to check the air quality and display a widget on his home screen.\r\n\r\nHe choose AWS Lambda for [on-demand compute](https://github.com/finiteloop/air-quality/blob/master/server/update_data/app.py#L53-L59), AWS S3 for [durable storage](https://github.com/finiteloop/air-quality/blob/master/server/update_data/app.py#L44-L50), and AWS CloudFront to push it to every region.\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1097592089502613504\" />\r\n\r\nBut to \"beat\" Heroku, you needed to be 10x better. And Serverless 1.0 was not 10x better.\r\n\r\n## Heroku in 2022\r\n\r\nHeroku has had a tough 2022 with multiple [security incidents](https://status.heroku.com/incidents/2413) and ongoing [outages](https://status.heroku.com/incidents/2402). This has led some teams who might have skipped the Serverless 1.0 era step back and reevaluate the current state. How are teams building today?\r\n\r\nHeroku's favorite framework – Ruby on Rails – is now hosted on GitHub Pages. None of the 15 Rails companies featured on the home page are using Heroku for their .com (as far as I can tell). Even the biggest Rails shop, GitHub, has started [building with React](https://primer.style/react/) on the frontend and moving the [backend to Kubernetes](https://www.theregister.com/2018/08/16/github_rails_microsoft/#:~:text=The%20company%20is%20moving%20away,Haskell%20being%20deployed%20for%20services).\r\n\r\nWhat developers loved about Heroku was that they **didn't have to manage infrastructure**. Somewhere along the way from monolith to microservices, application developers ended up doing DevOps again. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/), and [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) enabled a more lean DevOps experience, but still required managing, scaling, and debugging that infrastructure.\r\n\r\nExpectations for both frontend and backend experience have risen, making some developers abandon PaaS for a decoupled architecture allowing them to pick the best tools possible.\r\n\r\n## What can we learn from Heroku?\r\n\r\nI'm personally inspired by Heroku and have used the platform since 2012 for some side projects. We can learn a lot from their story and how it's shaped the software industry.\r\n\r\n- **Git push to URL is incredibly powerful:** When folks talk about Heroku 15 years later, they still mention `git push heroku main`. Heroku inspired platforms like Vercel with one command (`vercel`) to deploy your frontend globally, while having a singular remote (origin) and creating deeper integrations into first-party git providers (e.g. GitHub).\r\n- **Editing code in browser lowers the barrier to entry:** While Heroku pivoted away from an in-browser IDE, their ideas have led (either directly or indirectly) to the creation of Codepen, CodeSandbox, GitHub CodeSpaces, Replit, StackBlitz, and more.\r\n- **Don't forget about solo developer productivity:** Some developers still deploy monolithic applications to Heroku or other services like Fly.io, Railway, and Render to colocate their backend and frontend. They don't need (or want) to have microservices.\r\n- **Platforms need to evolve over time:** You could make the argument Heroku would be even more popular today if it evolved to add support for scaling to zero, global deployments by default, and focused on the rapidly evolving JavaScript/TypeScript/React ecosystem.\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1334595810240106497\" />\r\n\r\nI'm also biased, as I work at Vercel, in believing serverless and Edge platforms are the future. Here's my thoughts on where we're headed:\r\n\r\n- On the **frontend**, you want to `git push` and have your code close to your visitors globally. Platforms like Vercel help you go from idea to global app in seconds.\r\n- On the **backend**, you (probably) don't want to scale Kubernetes yourself. There's now fully-managed Kubernetes ([AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Google Cloud GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)), as well as [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run), which allows you to run and automatically scale stateless serverless containers.\r\n- **Serverless functions** don't need [health checks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/production-check#dyno-redundancy) and are [highly available (multi-az)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/security-resilience.html) without having to think about \"[number of dynos](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/production-check#dyno-redundancy)\". For each concurrent request, you get a function instance. Scaling is not something you spend time tuning or thinking much about. Entire categories of commands like `ps:stop`, `ps:restart`, and `ps:scale` disapper and become unnecessary.\r\n\r\nAnd that's all for now. Hopefully you now have a better appreciation how Heroku changed the software industry.

For me, that website is [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). Stripe is a company that allows people and businesses to accept payments online and in mobile apps. That doesn't sound like a company that would have an exquisite website design, but look at how Stripe describes themselves on their about page.\r\n\r\n> \"We think that building an internet business is a problem rooted in code and design, not finance.\"\r\n\r\nRather than making design an afterthought, it's treated as a first-class citizen at Stripe. You can almost feel the hours of work spent iterating over designs and making minor tweaks when viewing the website's pages. In this article, I'm going to break down how Stripe creates these beautiful designs and give some tips and tricks to web designers and developers alike.\r\n\r\n### The Design\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Stripe Website`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/website.png`}\r\n  width={2248}\r\n  height={1590}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nPictured above is the design for Stripe's main landing page. At first glance, here's what really sticks out to me:\r\n\r\n1.  Crisp typography\r\n2.  Stunning color palette\r\n3.  High-quality images\r\n4.  Bold call-to-action buttons\r\n\r\nLet's start with the first observation: the font.\r\n\r\n### Typography\r\n\r\nStripe uses a font called [Camphor](https://www.fontshop.com/families/camphor). It's a modern, uncluttered, sans serif font designed by Nick Job in 2010. It _really_ shines here and looks great in a variety of weights.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Camphor Font`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/camphor.png`}\r\n  width={1000}\r\n  height={1114}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nTypography is arguably the most important part of your design since it's the medium for your content. Stripe does an excellent job of using different weights and colors to provide adequate contrast. This draws your attention to the things that matter most.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Typography Example`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/typography.png`}\r\n  width={1162}\r\n  height={944}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nLet's see how we can make our font as crisp and clear as possible. First, we'll define our font family to be Camphor along with some fallback fonts. **Note:** Camphor is not free and should be purchased if you're planning to use it in production. However, I did find a [gist containing the font](https://gist.github.com/bdno86/d1f49b6f533df3f832b39d6cc3194303) which you can mess around with.\r\n\r\nWe can utilize the `text-rendering` CSS property to allow us to choose quality over speed, as well as some vendor specific properties to make our font sharper. **Note:** These should work for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on Mac.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbody {\r\n  font-family: Camphor, Open Sans, Segoe UI, sans-serif;\r\n  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\r\n  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\r\n  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nIn this example, I apply `-webkit-font-smoothing` followed by `text-rendering`.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`CSS Example`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/css-example.gif`}\r\n  width={1136}\r\n  height={898}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nOkay, so we have a solid font. Let's use it on some buttons!\r\n\r\n### User Experience (UX)\r\n\r\nIndicating a visual response when hovering over items like buttons and links provides a great user experience. In the example below, you'll notice the buttons shift _slightly_ up when hovered and change colors to a lighter shade of purple. The box-shadow also becomes a bit more intense.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Buttons Example`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/buttons.gif`}\r\n  width={980}\r\n  height={288}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbutton:hover {\r\n  color: #7795f8;\r\n  transform: translateY(-1px);\r\n  box-shadow: 0 7px 14px rgba(50, 50, 93, 0.1), 0 3px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis really makes it feel like the button is meant to be clicked. It's a wonderful experience. You can view code to recreate the buttons [here](https://codepen.io/leerob/pen/bYQRpB) on CodePen.\r\n\r\n### Color Palette\r\n\r\nI personally love the color palette of Stripe's website. It's bright and grabs your attention with some nice accent colors.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Color Palette`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/color-palette.png`}\r\n  width={1110}\r\n  height={275}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Utilizing SVGs\r\n\r\nSomething else that really stuck out to me was how high quality their images looked. This is because they use SVG ([Scalable Vector Graphic](https://svgontheweb.com/)) images instead of normal `.png` or `.jpg` files whenever possible. This has a multitude of benefits.\r\n\r\n- Smaller file sizes\r\n- Allows the ability to animate the image using CSS\r\n- Looks crisp on any size display from mobile to desktop\r\n\r\nThat tablet displayed on the home screen? Yeah, that's a `.svg` that's been scaled and rotated. Here's the `.svg` file from Stripe's website. Notice how when you zoom in the quality remains clear.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`SVG Example`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/salesforce.svg`}\r\n  width={420 * 2}\r\n  height={338 * 2}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Animations\r\n\r\nAnimations are the extra polish on top of an already beautiful design. Throughout all of Stripe's pages, you'll find a variety of animations like the ones shown below. Some are more subtle than others, but each serves a purpose.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Animation Example`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/spinning-animation.gif`}\r\n  width={1170}\r\n  height={418}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nHere's another example that I really like.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Another Animation Example`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/animation-example.gif`}\r\n  width={2198}\r\n  height={358}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nIf you've never worked with CSS animations, I wrote a quick article showing how to [learn them by example](/blog/learning-css-animations-by-example).\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed look into creating animations, I **highly recommend** [this blog post](https://stripe.com/blog/connect-front-end-experience) by Stripe's own Benjamin De Cock breaking down the front-end experience of their product [Connect](https://stripe.com/connect).\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nHopefully this article gave you some insight into how Stripe designs their websites and inspired you to create something of your own! Here's three main points to leave you with.\r\n\r\n- Typography choices are critical\r\n- Don't underestimate the value of good UX\r\n- Use SVG images whenever possible\r\n\r\nCheers! 🍻\r\n\r\n### Additional Resources\r\n\r\n- [Stripe Elements Examples](https://stripe.github.io/elements-examples/)\r\n- [React Stripe Elements](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-elements)\r\n- [Ember Stripe Elements](https://github.com/code-corps/ember-stripe-elements)\r\n- [Animate+ JavaScript Library](https://github.com/bendc/AnimatePlus)\r\n",

Being a proficient communicator spans your professional and personal life. There's a huge return on investment here. This should go without saying, but use proper spelling and grammar. On Slack, in emails, and everywhere else. Make it easy for others to understand the point you're trying to convey. Are you nervous speaking in front of others?

    "body": {
      "raw": "\r\nYou want to print the contents of a page. If you use the standard browser API, this will print the entirety of the _current_ page.\r\nIn this scenario, you can use the print media query to show/hide certain parts of the page.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@media print {\r\n  header,\r\n  footer {\r\n    display: none;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat if you want to print a **different page** from the current page?\r\n\r\n## Use Case\r\n\r\nLet's say you're building an e-commerce website. Users have requested they want the option to print a receipt after their purchase.\r\nYou don't want to mess with PDFs, so you'd like to use the web to create the structure and styling for you.\r\n\r\nAfter completing their payment, users should have the option to click a \"print receipt\" button.\r\nThis only loads the contents of the receipt and invokes the browser print dialog for them.\r\nIt should be reusable so we can reference the same receipt from their order history.\r\n\r\n## Using React & Iframes\r\n\r\nWhy do we need iframes to solve this problem?\r\nOur use case requires loading _only the receipt_ and nothing else. It should be available in other parts of the application as well.\r\n\r\nWe can create an `iframe` which loads the contents of our receipt. Once the content has finished loading, we can invoke the browser print API. This means it will only print what we want and allows us to reuse this component/route in other places.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nFirst, let's create an `iframe` that routes to our receipt.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<iframe\r\n  id=\"receipt\"\r\n  src=\"/payment/receipt\"\r\n  style={{ display: 'none' }}\r\n  title=\"Receipt\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe need to ensure the contents of that route have loaded, otherwise the page will be blank when trying to print.\r\nWe can communicate with the `iframe` from the receipt route to let it know we've finished loading.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nparent.postMessage({ action: 'receipt-loaded' });\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we need a way to invoke the print dialog.\r\nLet's create a component which sets up an event listener for the `receipt-loaded` message from the `iframe` receipt route.\r\nWhen the route has finished loading, we can click the `button`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\r\n\r\nfunction PaymentConfirmation() {\r\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);\r\n\r\n  const handleMessage = (event) => {\r\n    if (event.data.action === 'receipt-loaded') {\r\n      setIsLoading(false);\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const printIframe = (id) => {\r\n    const iframe = document.frames\r\n      ? document.frames[id]\r\n      : document.getElementById(id);\r\n    const iframeWindow = iframe.contentWindow || iframe;\r\n\r\n    iframe.focus();\r\n    iframeWindow.print();\r\n\r\n    return false;\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    window.addEventListener('message', handleMessage);\r\n\r\n    return () => {\r\n      window.removeEventListener('message', handleMessage);\r\n    };\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <iframe\r\n        id=\"receipt\"\r\n        src=\"/payment/receipt\"\r\n        style={{ display: 'none' }}\r\n        title=\"Receipt\"\r\n      />\r\n      <button onClick={() => printIframe('receipt')}>\r\n        {isLoading ? 'Loading...' : 'Print Receipt'}\r\n      </button>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default PaymentConfirmation;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** The above example uses [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) which are only available in React `>16.8.0`. If you're using an older version of React, use a `class` instead.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst printIframe = (id) => {\r\n  const iframe = document.frames\r\n    ? document.frames[id]\r\n    : document.getElementById(id);\r\n  const iframeWindow = iframe.contentWindow || iframe;\r\n\r\n  iframe.focus();\r\n  iframeWindow.print();\r\n\r\n  return false;\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass PaymentConfirmation extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      isLoading: true\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    this.handleMessage = this.handleMessage.bind(this);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentWillMount() {\r\n    window.addEventListener('message', this.handleMessage);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentWillUnmount() {\r\n    window.removeEventListener('message', this.handleMessage);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  handleMessage(event) {\r\n    if (event.data.action === 'receipt-loaded') {\r\n      this.setState({\r\n        isLoading: false\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <>\r\n        <iframe\r\n          id=\"receipt\"\r\n          src=\"/payment/receipt\"\r\n          style={{ display: 'none' }}\r\n          title=\"Receipt\"\r\n        />\r\n        <button onClick={() => printIframe('receipt')}>\r\n          {this.state.isLoading ?

When you’re in an environment with exponential company growth, you’re also likely to have exponential _personal_ growth.\r\n\r\nTo visualize growth, here’s a timeline of my work at Vercel alongside major events:\r\n\r\n- **Apr 2020:** Vercel announces $21M Series A.\r\n- **June 2020:** Vercel announces first-ever Next.js global community conference.\r\n- **July 2020:** I started helping plan and execute the conference (part-time).\r\n- **Sep 2020:** I join Vercel full-time as employee #34.\r\n- **Oct 2020:** We host Next.js Conf with 40,000 attendees.\r\n- **Oct 2020:** Next.js 10 makes some waves, our biggest release yet.\r\n- **Oct 2020:** We launch Vercel Analytics.\r\n- **Dec 2020:** Vercel announces $40M Series B.\r\n- **Jan 2021:** Next.js crosses 1,000,000 weekly downloads.\r\n- **Feb 2021:** I helped close our largest ARR enterprise customer to date.\r\n- **Apr 2021:** I’m promoted to [Head of Developer Relations](/blog/head-of-devrel).\r\n- **May 2021:** I start hiring Developer Advocates for my team.\r\n- **June 2021:** Vercel announces $102M Series C at a $1B valuation.\r\n- **June 2021:** We host the special edition of Next.js Conf and announce Next.js 12.\r\n- **June 2021:** We announce Next.js Live.\r\n- **July 2021:** [Delba](https://twitter.com/delba_oliveira) joins my team.\r\n- **July 2021:** [Steven](https://twitter.com/steventey) joins my team.\r\n- **Sep 2021:** [Hassan](https://twitter.com/Nutlope) joins my team.\r\n- **Oct 2021:** [Steph](https://twitter.com/steph_dietz_) joins my team.\r\n- **Oct 2021:** We host the 2nd Next.js Conf, which I helped script, record, film, and edit.\r\n- **Oct 2021:** We launch Vercel Checks and Edge Functions.\r\n- **Nov 2021:** Vercel announces $150M Series D at a $2.5B valuation.\r\n\r\nAnd that brings us to **today**:\r\n\r\n- **150+ Vercelians**, 5x larger than when I joined.\r\n- **30,000+ developers** in the Next.js Discord.\r\n- **2,000,000+ weekly downloads** for Next.js.\r\n- **4 Developer Advocates** on my team, growing more in 2022 👀\r\n- **[Incredible customers](https://vercel.com/customers)** like GitHub, McDonald’s, Uber, Patreon, Facebook, and more.\r\n\r\nHere’s some thoughts on my past year and a half at Vercel.\r\n\r\n### The Journey to Vercel\r\n\r\nIn 2017, I heard about this company making it simple to deploy your website. Just one command in the CLI and you're online. I remember checking out their product and feeling _connected_. This sleek, well-designed tool was for me. It helped me become a better developer and I was hooked.\r\n\r\nJoining Vercel came at the right time. I felt stagnant in my career, longing to spend more time being a creator and less time as a product engineer. I was excited by the Vercel product and even more excited about the team. So, I made the jump and joined.\r\n\r\nI joined as employee #34. I quickly got to know everyone and helped wherever possible. Hypergrowth feels like there’s more water coming into the boat than you have plugs to fill the holes with. I was able to help with engineering, product, design, presales, support, you name it. I helped our customers be successful using Vercel and Next.js.\r\n\r\nAs the company grew, I was able to double down and focus on what I do best: educating developers and building developer communities. We hired more engineers, more product managers, more engineering managers, more customer success managers, etc. Our customers succeeded and grew, and we grew with them.\r\n\r\n### Growing the Developer Relations Team\r\n\r\nHiring is incredibly difficult. When I moved into leading DevRel, I knew I needed to grow a team, but first I had to create the foundation. I tried to document as much of my process and workflow as possible. In an ideal situation, I’m able to “clone” myself with my first hire. They learn the tips and tricks I use to handle my job effectively. Then, for the next hire, we have two people to help influence. And so on (thanks, [Delba](https://www.delbaoliveira.com/)!).\r\n\r\nFor me, the hardest part of growing a team is delegation. It’s hard to give up ownership over something you’ve carefully crafted or implemented. It requires an immense level of trust in those you’re delegating responsibility and ownership to. This comes back to hiring. Finding people I could trust, and then working to strengthen that trust, has made our team highly effective.\r\n\r\nIt's still early days for DevRel at Vercel, but I'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished. Some recent highlights:\r\n\r\n- Hassan just spoke at the [Prisma Serverless Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mg2zD_DaOU&list=PLn2e1F9Rfr6lQzahh7M8NcQpYnlYBHZqe&index=5)\r\n- Steph just spoke at [Svelte Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCoaJBmojUE)\r\n- Delba created two videos ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYBiB6Vt9w), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB-WaTs1KHY)) for Next.js Conf and is speaking at [React Conf](https://conf.reactjs.org/)\r\n- Steven helped create [vercel.com/edge](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions) and examples for [platforms on Vercel](https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1458527553728090115)\r\n\r\n### Full-Time Remote Work\r\n\r\nI joined Vercel without having worked remotely full-time (only part-time). I was incredibly scared about missing the in-person parts of work I enjoyed: being able to work on hard problems together with someone in the same room, the easy opportunities to chat about non-work stuff and learn more about my co-workers, and the clear separation between home and work.\r\n\r\nNow, these are all solvable problems in a remote world. But they’re not _easy_. Both myself and the company I work for have to be intentional about not losing the best parts about being in person. Especially with a globally distributed team.\r\n\r\nIn one of my first jobs, I’d meet up with three other people to carpool every morning. Most mornings, the _last_ thing I wanted was to make small talk in the car before work. I wanted to sleep. So, I would struggle to get 30 minutes more of sleep before going into my 8 hour day. Then, back to the carpool for the ride home. Rinse and repeat.\r\n\r\nReflecting on this, I couldn’t fathom how unhealthy it sounded for me. I wanted more flexibility with my schedule. Some days, I wanted to get that extra 30 minutes of sleep and then stay an hour later. Other days, I wanted to leave as soon as possible and enjoy the nice weather. But I was bound to the shackles of the 9 to 5 and my limiting carpool. I thought about the mornings I’d get up and hit snooze for _five more minutes_. Then, I contrasted to today.\r\n\r\nToday, I wake up depending on my schedule for the day. Sometimes I’ll sleep in a bit later, others I’ll wake up extra early and go to the gym. When I wake up, there’s no carpool. There’s no 30 minutes of forced sleep and 30 minutes of small talk on the ride home. I just walk to my office in the other room. I can design my day to _best fit my life_. I can make accommodations for my life _first_ and work second. The flexibility of remote work is a privilege and one that I am thankful for every day.\r\n\r\n### What's Next?\r\n\r\nFor Vercel, we're just getting started. Earlier this month, Rich Harris joined to [work on Svelte full-time](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-welcomes-rich-harris-creator-of-svelte). Many more exciting announcements are coming in the following months. As outlined in our [Series D post](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-funding-series-d-and-valuation), we're going to use this funding to:\r\n\r\n- **Support open-source software**\r\n- **Make the Web Edge-first**\r\n- **Build the end-to-end development platform**\r\n- **Grow our team**\r\n\r\nI’ve grown more as a developer and creator in the past year and a half than in the previous five. I'm excited to keep educating and helping developers succeed with React, Svelte, or any frontend framework of their choice.\r\n\r\n_Thanks to [@signalnoise](https://signalnoise.com/magnatron-20) for the banner art._\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\nThis tutorial will show you how to create a Next.js application that:\r\n\r\n- Fetches content from a PostgreSQL database (Supabase)\r\n- Updates content without needing to redeploy to Vercel\r\n- Serves optimized, blur-up images with `next/image`\r\n- Easily styles components with Tailwind CSS\r\n\r\nI used this to create [swag.vercel.app](https://swag.vercel.app), which is a collection of tweets from the Next.js community showing off their swag.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Example of the image gallery`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/image-gallery-supabase-tailwind-nextjs/swag.png`}\r\n  width={2812 / 2}\r\n  height={2140 / 2}\r\n  priority\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nTo set up your application, we can use `create-next-app` to clone a Next.js and Tailwind CSS starter application from the official [examples directory](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpx create-next-app --example with-tailwindcss image-gallery\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example includes:\r\n\r\n- The latest version of Next.js\r\n- Prettier configured to format code and organize Tailwind CSS class names\r\n- TypeScript configured for Next.js\r\n- Tailwind CSS configured to strip away unused class names\r\n- An example Next.js [API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\r\n\r\n## Styling the Image Gallery\r\n\r\nNow that Tailwind is configured, we can create components to style our image gallery. Inside `pages/index.tsx`, which is the entry point into our application, let's use CSS Grid to set up the container for our images. We'll add some padding and grid spacing, which conditionally changes based on the viewport.\r\n\r\n```jsx:pages/index.tsx\r\nexport default function Gallery() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"max-w-2xl mx-auto py-16 px-4 sm:py-24 sm:px-6 lg:max-w-7xl lg:px-8\">\r\n      <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-y-10 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 xl:gap-x-8\">\r\n        {/* Images will go here */}\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, we need to create a component for the individual image. Not only do we want to show the image, but we also would like to show some additional metadata. In this instance, I'm adding a name and Twitter handle. Each image will also link out to the original tweet.\r\n\r\nLet's make a new component with placeholder data:\r\n\r\n```jsx:pages/index.tsx\r\nfunction Image() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <a href=\"#\" className=\"group\">\r\n      <div className=\"w-full aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden xl:aspect-w-7 xl:aspect-h-8\">\r\n        <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bit.ly/placeholder-img\" className=\"group-hover:opacity-75\" />\r\n      </div>\r\n      <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-sm text-gray-700\">Lee Robinson</h3>\r\n      <p className=\"mt-1 text-lg font-medium text-gray-900\">@leeerob</p>\r\n    </a>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe're using [group modifiers](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#styling-based-on-parent-state) to make the hover area the _entire_ component, including the text, making the image's opacity dimmed. We're also ensuring the image maintains a 1:1 aspect ratio (square), which requires a Tailwind CSS plugin. Let's install that.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm i -D @tailwindcss/aspect-ratio\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we can update our `tailwind.config.js` file:\r\n\r\n```js:tailwind.config.js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  content: [\r\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\r\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\r\n  ],\r\n  theme: {\r\n    extend: {},\r\n  },\r\n  plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio')],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Optimizing Images\r\n\r\nTo help achieve good [Core Web Vitals](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/web-performance), we want to optimize images. Next.js provides an [Image component](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) that gives us:\r\n\r\n- **Faster Page Loads:** Images are only loaded when they enter the viewport\r\n- **Visual Stability:** Prevents [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/web-performance/cls) automatically\r\n- **Improved Performance:** Images use modern image formats (like WebP) for smaller file sizes and serve smaller images based on the device size\r\n\r\nLet's update our `Image` component to use `next/image`, and rename it to `BlurImage` to prevent a naming collison with the `Image` component we imported:\r\n\r\n```jsx {1,7-13}:pages/index.tsx\r\nimport Image from 'next/image';\r\n\r\nfunction BlurImage() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <a href=\"#\" className=\"group\">\r\n      <div className=\"w-full aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden xl:aspect-w-7 xl:aspect-h-8\">\r\n        <Image\r\n          alt=\"\"\r\n          src=\"https://bit.ly/placeholder-img\"\r\n          layout=\"fill\"\r\n          objectFit=\"cover\"\r\n          className=\"group-hover:opacity-75\"\r\n        />\r\n      </div>\r\n      <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-sm text-gray-700\">Lee Robinson</h3>\r\n      <p className=\"mt-1 text-lg font-medium text-gray-900\">@leeerob</p>\r\n    </a>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll use the [fill layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#layout) and `object-fit` [CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) to properly scale the image.\r\n\r\nThe Next.js Image component requires an allowlist to specify which domains we can optimize images from. While we're using `bit.ly` as a placeholder, we can add any domain we want to the allowlist inside `next.config.js`:\r\n\r\n```js:next.config.js\r\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  reactStrictMode: true,\r\n  images: {\r\n    domains: ['bit.ly'],\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Blurred Placeholders for Images\r\n\r\nWhen images are loading, we'd like to show a blurred version for a better user experience. While the Image component does include this for [local image files](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization#local-images), we're going to be retrieving images from Supabase soon. Instead, we can use `onLoadingComplete` and CSS animation + blur to achieve a similar effect.\r\n\r\n```jsx {2,4-6,9,19-25}:pages/index.tsx\r\nimport Image from 'next/image';\r\nimport { useState } from 'react';\r\n\r\nfunction cn(...classes: string[]) {\r\n  return classes.filter(Boolean).join(' ');\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction BlurImage() {\r\n  const [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(true);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <a href=\"#\" className=\"group\">\r\n      <div className=\"w-full aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden xl:aspect-w-7 xl:aspect-h-8\">\r\n        <Image\r\n          alt=\"\"\r\n          src=\"https://bit.ly/placeholder-img\"\r\n          layout=\"fill\"\r\n          objectFit=\"cover\"\r\n          className={cn(\r\n            'group-hover:opacity-75 duration-700 ease-in-out',\r\n            isLoading\r\n              ? 'grayscale blur-2xl scale-110'\r\n              : 'grayscale-0 blur-0 scale-100'\r\n          )}\r\n          onLoadingComplete={() => setLoading(false)}\r\n        />\r\n      </div>\r\n      <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-sm text-gray-700\">Lee Robinson</h3>\r\n      <p className=\"mt-1 text-lg font-medium text-gray-900\">@leeerob</p>\r\n    </a>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, let's replace our placeholder data with real items from Supabase.\r\n\r\n## Setting Up Supabase\r\n\r\n[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) makes it really easy to create your [backend](/blog/backend), giving you a PostgreSQL database in a few clicks. Inside our Supabase dashboard, let's configure our new project:\r\n\r\n- Click \"New project\"\r\n- Choose your organization\r\n- Pick a name, database password, and click \"Create new project\"\r\n\r\nAfter your project is created, you'll want to click copy and save these two values:\r\n\r\n- **Project API keys → `service_role`:** This is how we'll securely connect to Supabase on the server.\r\n- **Configuration → URL:** This is the API endpoint the Supabase client will use to fetch and edit data.\r\n\r\nSave these values as [Environment Variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) inside a new file `.env.local` inside your Next.js application:\r\n\r\n```bash:.env.local\r\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-value-here\r\nSUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-value-here\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, install the Supabase client:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm i @supabase/supabase-js\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we can create a new client and connect to Supabase using our environment variables:\r\n\r\n```jsx:pages/index.tsx\r\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';\r\n\r\nconst supabaseAdmin = createClient(\r\n  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,\r\n  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Adding Data to Supabase\r\n\r\nFirst, we will need to create a new table inside Supabase for our images.\r\n\r\n- We'll name our table `images`\r\n- We'll keep the `id` and `created_at` columns as is\r\n- Let's add `name`, `href`, `userName`, and `imageSrc` columns, which are all `text`\r\n- Click \"Save\" and we're done!\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Example of the image gallery`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/image-gallery-supabase-tailwind-nextjs/supabase.png`}\r\n  width={2900 / 2}\r\n  height={2228 / 2}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nWe can add data directly through the Supabase web editor, but for demonstration purposes, here's how we could insert data using our Supabase client:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nawait supabaseAdmin.from('images').insert([{\r\n  name: 'Pedro Duarte',\r\n  href: 'https://twitter.com/peduarte/status/1463897468383412231',\r\n  username: '@peduarte',\r\n  imageSrc: 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FFDOtLkWYAsWjTM?format=jpg',\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n<Callout emoji=\"💡\">\r\n  You could also use [Supabase Storage](https://supabase.com/storage) to save\r\n  the images.\r\n</Callout>\r\n\r\n## Fetching Data from Supabase\r\n\r\nWe've already set up our Supabase client in the file, so we can `select` all images from our `images` table:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst { data } = await supabaseAdmin.from('images').select('*');\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll fetch this data inside `getStaticProps`. [This function](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) allows you to fetch data on the server and return it as props for the default React component exported in the Page:\r\n\r\n```jsx {8-15,17-23,25}:pages/index.tsx\r\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';\r\n\r\nconst supabaseAdmin = createClient(\r\n  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,\r\n  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\r\n  const { data } = await supabaseAdmin.from('images').select('*');\r\n  return {\r\n    props: {\r\n      images: data\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Image = {\r\n  id: number\r\n  href: string\r\n  imageSrc: string\r\n  name: string\r\n  username: string\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default function Gallery({ images }: { images: Image[] }) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"max-w-2xl mx-auto py-16 px-4 sm:py-24 sm:px-6 lg:max-w-7xl lg:px-8\">\r\n      <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-y-10 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 xl:gap-x-8\">\r\n        {/* Images will go here */}\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll also add a type for our `Image` data returned from Supabase. Next, we can update our placeholder for images to use the real data. We'll also use our new `BlurImage` component, which makes use of `next/image` under the hood:\r\n\r\n```jsx {5-7}:pages/index.tsx\r\nexport default function Gallery({ images }: { images: Image[] }) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"max-w-2xl mx-auto py-16 px-4 sm:py-24 sm:px-6 lg:max-w-7xl lg:px-8\">\r\n      <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-y-10 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 xl:gap-x-8\">\r\n        {images.map((image) => (\r\n          <BlurImage key={image.id} image={image} />\r\n        ))}\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter mapping through the list of `images`, we forward the current `image` as a prop to our `BlurImage` component. Let's update that component to replace the placeholder data:\r\n\r\n```jsx {1,5,9,21,22}:pages/index.tsx\r\nfunction BlurImage({ image }: { image: Image }) {\r\n  const [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(true);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <a href={image.href} className=\"group\">\r\n      <div className=\"w-full aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden xl:aspect-w-7 xl:aspect-h-8\">\r\n        <Image\r\n          alt=\"\"\r\n          src={image.imageSrc}\r\n          layout=\"fill\"\r\n          objectFit=\"cover\"\r\n          className={cn(\r\n            'group-hover:opacity-75 duration-700 ease-in-out',\r\n            isLoading\r\n              ? 'grayscale blur-2xl scale-110'\r\n              : 'grayscale-0 blur-0 scale-100'\r\n          )}\r\n          onLoadingComplete={() => setLoading(false)}\r\n        />\r\n      </div>\r\n      <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-sm text-gray-700\">{image.name}</h3>\r\n      <p className=\"mt-1 text-lg font-medium text-gray-900\">{image.username}</p>\r\n    </a>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll want to update our image optimization allowlist to use the Twitter image URL:\r\n\r\n```js:next.config.js\r\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  reactStrictMode: true,\r\n  images: {\r\n    domains: ['pbs.twimg.com'],\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deploying to Vercel\r\n\r\nOur image gallery is now showing a list of images, fetched from Supabase, and displayed nicely using Tailwind CSS. Let's deploy our Next.js application to Vercel:\r\n\r\n1.  Push your code to your git repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)\r\n2.  [Import your Next.js project](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel\r\n3.  Add your [Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) during the import\r\n4.  Click \"Deploy\"\r\n\r\nVercel will auto-detect you are using Next.js and enable the correct settings for your deployment. Finally, your application is deployed at a URL like [swag.vercel.app](https://swag.vercel.app/).\r\n\r\nDuring the build process (`next build`), your application made a request to Supabase (by running `getStaticProps`) to fetch the images needed and generate an HTML file for the page. This file is static and **does not change** when you update your database.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you added a new image to the table, it would not be shown on your deployed application without rebuilding the entire app. Let's fix that.\r\n\r\n## On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration\r\n\r\n[Next.js 12.1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-1) included a helpful feature called [on-demand ISR](https://on-demand-isr.vercel.app/) that allows you to fetch updated data for any page _after_ it's been deployed. [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) allows you to keep the benefits of static files (which are fast and reliable) while still updating your site when data changes.\r\n\r\nLet's enable our application to re-run `getStaticProps` when our `images` table changes.\r\n\r\n### Supabase Function Hooks\r\n\r\nFunction Hooks allow you to listen to any changes on your tables and trigger an asynchronous function. For example:\r\n\r\n- I add a new row to my `images` table (i.e. `INSERT`)\r\n- My function hook is triggered after the database row changes\r\n- I'm able to call an API Route inside my application to fetch new data and rebuild the page\r\n\r\nThis means I'm able to instantly rebuild a single page of my application and push the new file to Vercel's Edge Network in 300ms globally 🤯\r\n\r\n### Creating our Revalidation API Route\r\n\r\nInside our Next.js application, we'll make a new API Route to revalidate our page. This route is secured by a secret query parameter that our Supabase instance will forward, to ensure that only Supabase can regenerate pages when data changes.\r\n\r\n```jsx:pages/api/revalidate.ts\r\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\r\n  // Check for secret to confirm this is a valid request\r\n  if (req.query.secret !== process.env.REVALIDATE_SECRET) {\r\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  try {\r\n    // Regenerate our index route showing the images\r\n    await res.unstable_revalidate('/');\r\n    return res.json({ revalidated: true });\r\n  } catch (err) {\r\n    // If there was an error, Next.js will continue\r\n    // to show the last successfully generated page\r\n    return res.status(500).send('Error revalidating');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll then want to add this new Environment Variable to your `.env.local` file, as well as on Vercel, before we deploy these changes.\r\n\r\n```bash:.env.local\r\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-value-here\r\nSUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-value-here\r\nREVALIDATE_SECRET=your-value-here\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Creating our Function Hook\r\n\r\nInside the Supabase dashboard, click on your Database and then:\r\n\r\n- Click \"Function Hooks\" on the left sidebar\r\n- Click \"Create a new hook\"\r\n- We'll name our hook `update_images`\r\n- Table → `images`\r\n- Events → Insert, Update, and Delete\r\n- Type of hook → HTTP Request\r\n- HTTP Request Method → POST\r\n- HTTP Request URL → `your-url.vercel.app/api/revalidate`\r\n- HTTP Params → Add a new param `secret` with your secret from above\r\n- Click \"Confirm\"\r\n\r\nOur function hook is now active and will make a request to the specified HTTP Request URL whenever the `images` table changes.\r\n\r\n## On-Demand ISR in Action\r\n\r\nFirst, redeploy your application to Vercel to add the new API Route as well as the new Environment Variable (`REVALIDATE_SECRET`). Next, add a new row to the `images` table inside Supabase.\r\n\r\nAfter hitting \"Save\", you should see your deployed application **update instantly**!\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we were able to create a Next.js application showing a list of images fetched dynamically from Supabase and instantly update our deployed application whenever data changes.\r\n\r\n- [View the code](https://github.com/leerob/image-gallery-supabase-tailwind-nextjs)\r\n- [View the demo](https://swag.vercel.app)\r\n- [Try On-Demand ISR](https://on-demand-isr.vercel.app/)\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Cinque Terre`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/banner.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1000}\r\n  priority\r\n/>\r\n\r\nIt all starts with a cheap flight.\r\n\r\nBack in May, I was browsing flights to Europe hoping to plan a vacation for the fall.\r\nOriginally thinking Greece, I managed to notice a cheap flight from Des Moines to Venice. It seemed too good to be true.\r\n\r\nMy fiancée and I decided to pull the trigger after realizing how many unused credit card reward points we had. There were only 4 seats left, so we quickly scrambled to grab our passports and fill out the information.\r\nWe'd be starting and ending in Venice - the rest we would figure out later. A few minutes later, it was finalized.\r\n\r\nWe were going to Italy! 🇮🇹\r\n\r\n## Why Backpacking?\r\n\r\nI love minimalism, especially in regards to traveling. Lugging around two checked bags and a carry-on is expensive and often unnecessary.\r\nPlus, we knew we'd be going from planes to trains and doing a decent amount of walking.\r\n\r\nWe had heard good things about [Tom Bihn's Aeronaut 45](https://www.tombihn.com/products/aeronaut-45?variant=34039227783) backpack from a friend.\r\nIt's the maximum carry-on size most airlines accept and is very versatile. It can be worn as a backpack or carried like a bag.\r\nThere are ample pockets and containers to organize and store your belongings. It was a perfect match.\r\n\r\nWe were able to fit 10 days of clothes, shoes, toiletries, and photography gear into our respective bags with ease. The backpack straps were comfortable enough to support long walks.\r\nOverall, I would highly recommend this bag for others considering downsizing their luggage.\r\n\r\n## Venice\r\n\r\nAfter a pretty seamless overnight flight connecting through Chicago, we arrived in Venice in the morning.\r\nThis might be an unpopular opinion, but I _love_ airplane food on international flights. It could be the lack of other options, but it always hits the spot 💯\r\n\r\nShortly after landing, we got some euros out of the ATM (_\\*bancomat_) and caught a bus to Venezia Mestre.\r\nOur Airbnb was only a few blocks from the Mestre train station. We chose to stay outside of the main city center to avoid some of the tourists and get a cheaper rate.\r\nTraveling into the city via train was fairly simple, even for unexperienced train passengers.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Mestre to Venice Train`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/train.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1000}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nVenice's gritty landscape, unique alleyways, and water taxis were charming. However, even outside the busy summer months, it was still very touristy.\r\nWe nabbed some fresh pizza and spent the rest of the afternoon exploring the canals.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Venice, Italy`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/venice.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1000}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nSome parts of Venice were very dirty and using the public restroom was not an enjoyable experience.\r\nI wouldn't recommend more than a few days in Venice - but I'm glad we saw it.\r\n\r\n## Cinqué Terre\r\n\r\nWe rose early the next morning to catch a series of trains to Manarola.\r\nWe went through Florence and La Spezia before finally arriving in Manarola. It took about 4 hours in total.\r\n\r\nThe [Trenitalia](https://trenitalia.com) trails with designated seats were excellent. We sat back, relaxed, and took in the countryside.\r\nThe regional trains... not so much. We were packed like sardines on the two-hour leg from Florence to La Spezia.\r\nAlas, we arrived in Manarola with the afternoon ahead of us.\r\n\r\nWe trekked up and down the steep city streets searching for a place to eat.\r\nAfter eating the most amazing pesto gnocchi I've ever had (seriously), we grabbed two cones of fresh gelato across the street.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Gelato`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/gelato.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1000}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThe laid-back pace of Manarola was more of the vibe we were looking for.\r\nThe city by the sea had exquisite character, from the small gift shops to the unique houses airing their laundry out to dry on the balcony.\r\nHaving a few drinks didn't hurt, either.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Manarola`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/manarola.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1000}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThat night, we both struggled to sleep. Our sleep schedule still hadn't caught up from the 7-hour time change.\r\nThe next morning we rose early and went on a brisk hike up the mountain-side for a better view of the city.\r\nThe crisp ocean air, sunny skies, and 70-degree weather made it worth the steep incline.\r\n\r\nTo cool off from the hike, we took a brisk dip in the Mediterranean Sea. It wasn't exactly _warm_.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Swimming at Manarola`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/swimming.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1000}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nOne of the highlights of the trip was the unbelievable sunset we witnessed.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Cinque Terre Sunset`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/sunset.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1000}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nWhen I look back on Cinqué Terre, I'll remember a few things: pesto gnocchi, chocolate chip gelato, and the amazing views.\r\n\r\n## Naples\r\n\r\nOur next destination was the Almafi Coast, but we wanted to break up the travel day to be a bit shorter.\r\nWe decided to stop for a quick night in Naples before heading out early for the Almafi Coast.\r\n\r\nNaples is the 3rd largest city in Italy. I can't really summarize the entire city in our short time there,\r\nbut our experience was pretty average. Highlights include excellent pizza, great wine, and a short walk to the train station.\r\nEverything else was pretty lackluster. There are definitely some sketchy areas and questionable people.\r\nI'm not sure it's fair to judge the entire city based on this, but I'm not sure I would recommend it.\r\n\r\nWhile in Naples, we met up with our two friends Clare and Liz. They joined us for our stay in Praiano.\r\n\r\n## Praiano (Almafi Coast)\r\n\r\nThe Almafi Coast consists of a handful of towns, but the most famous by far is Positano.\r\nYou've probably seen a picture similar to this before. It's iconic.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Positano, Italy`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/positano.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1125}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nOur decision to stay in Praiano over Positano was mostly based on cost.\r\nAn added bonus of this was being just far away from the main tourist areas. At night, we sat on our balcony and listened to the ocean in silence. It was beautiful.\r\n\r\nOne of the _best_ decisions we made was to hire a private transfer from Naples to Praiano.\r\nThere isn't really a direct route to Praiano or Positano. We could have also taken the train into Sorrento and then got a transfer or taken the water taxi.\r\nBut why bother?\r\nOur driver was prompt and did an excellent job of navigating the tight, windy roads and erratic drivers.\r\nRenting a car would have been an expensive mistake. I would highly recommend [Daytrip](https://mydaytrip.com/) - it's what we used.\r\n\r\nGroceries and restaurants were a short walk away (but with steep inclines, ouch).\r\nThe grocery stores were very affordable in Praiano, especially splitting between the four of us.\r\n\r\nI'd highly recommend getting out on the water if you can. We did a boat tour out to the island of Capri, which was fantastic.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`On a boat in Positano, Italy`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/boat.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={2250}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Capri, Italy`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/capri.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1875}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Quick Tips\r\n\r\nIf you're planning to head to Italy, here's a few things you should know (plus some general travel tips):\r\n\r\n- Keep tabs on flights and [track prices](https://support.google.com/travel/answer/6235879?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).\r\n- Ideally, book your lodging months in advance for the best rates. I'd suggest a mix of Airbnb/Hotels depending on the location.\r\n- Make sure you get an [outlet converter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L87GPPT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\r\n- Electricity in Italy conforms to the European standard of 220V to 230V, with a frequency of 50Hz. Don't plug an electric razor in without checking if it's dual-voltage 😲\r\n- If you haven't already, consider getting [TSA Precheck](https://www.tsa.gov/precheck) / [Global Entry](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry).\r\n- Ensure your credit card doesn't have international fees.\r\n- I would recommend taking out some euros ahead of time or at the airport. There will be places that don't accept a credit card.\r\n- Use [Google Translate](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-translate/id414706506) and download Italian offline, in case of spotty coverage.\r\n- If you use Spotify, consider downloading some playlists offline as well.\r\n- Check into your flight as early as possible!\r\n",

    "image": "/static/images/learn-nextjs/nextjs-trend.png",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Next.js Trend`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/learn-nextjs/nextjs-trend.png`}\r\n  width={1116}\r\n  height={746}\r\n  priority\r\n/>\r\n\r\nYou've heard great things about this new web framework called [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),\r\nbut you're still not sure _why_ people are using it.\r\n\r\nOne way to understand why you should learn Next.js is to understand what problems it solves. This directly translates to why it's become so popular.\r\n\r\n## Why Use A Framework?\r\n\r\nLet's say you're a new startup trying to launch a website. You might have some requirements like:\r\n\r\n- Splash page with information about the product\r\n- About page describing the team\r\n- Frequently asked questions\r\n- Capture leads through a contact form\r\n- Subscribe to a newsletter\r\n\r\nThere's nothing in these requirements which dictate the need for a framework.\r\nYou could absolutely deliver on these requirements using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we have some foresight, we might know that future requirements call for a user authentication flow and the beginnings of a SaaS product.\r\n\r\n**The real value in using a framework** is developer productivity, shared knowledge, code reuse, and creating a platform for the future.\r\nIf we start with React/Next.js, we can satisfy the initial requirements with ease _and_ pave the way for the next iteration of the product.\r\n\r\n## React\r\n\r\n[React](https://reactjs.org/) has become the industry standard for building modern web applications.\r\nOf 90,000 developers [surveyed by Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019), React was the most loved and most wanted web framework.\r\n\r\nWhy? With React, you can build anything from simple marketing splash pages to full-fledged web applications on the scale of Facebook.\r\nIt's flexible and composable. Developers love this.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`React.js Trend`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/learn-nextjs/react-trend.png`}\r\n  width={1116}\r\n  height={742}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThis trend means that more developers than ever are learning React, and thus JavaScript as well.\r\nIt's become one of the hottest skills recruiters are looking for. JavaScript is the [#1 language used](https://octoverse.github.com/) according to GitHub.\r\n\r\n<a aria-label=\"GitHub Octoberse\" href=\"https://octoverse.github.com/\">\r\n  <Image\r\n    alt={`GitHub Octoberse`}\r\n    src={`/static/images/learn-nextjs/github.png`}\r\n    width={1388}\r\n    height={962}\r\n  />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nFor companies, this means you're more likely to find employees who already know React.\r\nFor developers, this makes a very advantageous skill to add to your skillset.\r\n\r\nAccording to [NPM trends](https://www.npmtrends.com/), it's outpacing other web frameworks like Angular and Vue by **~5 million installs/day**.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`NPM Install Trend`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/learn-nextjs/npm-trend.png`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={621}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThis doesn't mean React is perfect. Since you're loading content client-side, you have to\r\nwait for the JavaScript bundle to load before you can determine what to show on the page. This can be problematic for users\r\nwith slower connections.\r\n\r\nPlus, search engines still struggle with indexing client-side JavaScript applications.\r\nIf you're concerned about Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and want your content indexed faster, it's better to send the markup from the server.\r\nEnter Next.js.\r\n\r\n## Next.js\r\n\r\n[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) solves both of those problems using server-side rendering. Next's framework allows you to build scalable, performant React code without the configuration hassle.\r\nThat's why so many companies depend on Next for shipping production applications.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Companies using Next.js`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/learn-nextjs/companies.png`}\r\n  width={2344}\r\n  height={380}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Zero-Config Approach\r\n\r\nTo properly ship a performant React application, there are a lot of things you must do right.\r\nYou'll want to correctly configure [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) so you can use modern JavaScript features, but still support legacy browsers.\r\nYou'll also want to bundle up all of your assets (e.g. multiple JavaScript files) to be included in your HTML file (using something like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)). The list goes on.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be nice to not have to worry about this?\r\n\r\nThis \"JavaScript fatigue\" prompted the creation of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (CRA), which dramatically improved the developer experience of spinning up a new React app. But can we do better?\r\n\r\n- Next.js supports IE11 and all modern browsers out of the box. Babel is configured for you, with an escape hatch to override if you need to.\r\n- CRA combines all the JavaScript files into a single bundle, whereas Next.js has support for code splitting. When I visit `/route`, we're **only loading the JavaScript used on that page**. Better performance!\r\n- Want to handle routing with CRA?

In my opinion, no one does a better job than [Stripe](/blog/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites). After reading their article about how they redesigned [Connect](https://stripe.com/blog/connect-front-end-experience), I was determined to learn more about creating animations using only CSS.\r\n\r\nI've found I learn best by doing - creating tangible examples where I have to apply the skills I've studied. My mission was to learn more about CSS animations. To achieve that goal, I came up with a fun idea to make an Iowa State logo animated to swirl like a tornado.\r\n\r\n### Creating The Logo\r\n\r\nThe Cyclone's logo in the late 80's to early 90's represented a tornado. Here's the base I started with.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Iowa State Cyclones Logo`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/learning-css-animations-by-example/isu-logo.png`}\r\n  width={1003}\r\n  height={700}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nI took this .png into Adobe Illustrator to create an SVG [(Scalable Vector Graphic)](https://svgontheweb.com/). SVGs look crisp at all screen resolutions, have super small file sizes, and can be easily edited and modified. I traced the path of the tornado as seen below and created the .svg file.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Adobe Illustrator SVG Creation`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/learning-css-animations-by-example/illustrator.png`}\r\n  width={1593}\r\n  height={1319}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Learning About Animations\r\n\r\nCSS3 animations allow you to gradually change from one style to another. To define how those styles change at certain times, we use a `@keyframes` rule. In the example below, I've created a `keyframes` rule entitled \"color\" to change the `fill` selector to different colors based on the percentage complete. This will change the logo from cardinal → gold → cardinal.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@keyframes color {\r\n  0% {\r\n    fill: #99002f;\r\n  }\r\n  50% {\r\n    fill: #ffc426;\r\n  }\r\n  100% {\r\n    fill: #99002f;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe need to specify which element we want to bind this animation to. Using the `animation` property, we can apply the `color` rule and configure how it runs. Animations have six different properties:\r\n\r\n- `animation-name`\r\n- `animation-duration`\r\n- `animation-timing-function`\r\n- `animation-delay`\r\n- `animation-iteration-count`\r\n- `animation-direction`\r\n- `animation-fill-mode`\r\n\r\nFor more information on the specifics of each property, check out the [full documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp). Here's how we would apply these properties to make our logo change colors.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nsvg path {\r\n  animation-name: color;\r\n  animation-duration: 2s;\r\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite;\r\n  animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.85, 0.01, 0.25, 1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use the short-hand version.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nsvg path {\r\n  animation: color 2s infinite cubic-bezier(0.85, 0.01, 0.25, 1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis applies the \"color\" `@keyframes` rule to the SVG's path which will repeat forever in 2-second increments using the [cubic-bezier](http://cubic-bezier.com/#.17,.67,.83,.67) timing function. We can apply this same idea to make the logo spin. First, let's create another `@keyframes` rule for spinning.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@keyframes spin {\r\n  0% {\r\n    transform: rotateX(-20deg) rotateY(20deg);\r\n  }\r\n  100% {\r\n    transform: rotateX(-20deg) rotateY(740deg);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, let's apply this rule to our container element.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.container {\r\n  animation: spin 2s infinite cubic-bezier(0.85, 0.01, 0.25, 1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Final Result 🎉\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Iowa State Animated Logo`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/learning-css-animations-by-example/isu-logo.gif`}\r\n  width={801}\r\n  height={209}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nYou can view the code and a live example on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leerob/pen/BmGZZQ?editors=1100).\r\n",

Workiva is a software company based out of Ames, Iowa that helps companies work smart. Their main product, Wdesk, is a cloud-based work management platform focused around financial documents. If you want to learn even more, check out their [website](https://www.workiva.com). Fun fact: Over 70% of Fortune 500 companies use Workiva's software for their SEC filings.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### My Role\r\n\r\nI work as a Software Engineer on the Insight team. Essentially, our team helps make the lives of Workiva engineers easier. We created and actively develop tools to monitor and report errors that customers face when using Wdesk. This helps decrease the amount of time it takes to analyze and fix issues our customers face. Our support teams can then quickly react to issues, and in some cases stop them before customers even notice.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of a scenario where our team helps: a customer is happily using Wdesk until unexpectedly a button does not work like they expected it to. Immediately, an error is logged off and sent back to us. After navigating through the proper channels, it arrives and we process the error. Using logic that we've created, we answer questions like: Has this error happened before? How many times has it happened? Is it spinning out of control? Should we contact someone? After answering these questions, we typically end up sending out a message to the interested parties letting them know a user hit this error and giving them all the information they need to investigate it.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`HipChat Message`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/life-at-workiva/hipchat.png`}\r\n  width={1089}\r\n  height={326}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThis workflow has streamlined the support process for a number of teams internally and has helped us produce a better product for our customers. We're constantly pushing the boundaries for improving the customer experience and providing a positive experience using our software.\r\n\r\n### Our Campus\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite parts about Workiva is the campus. We have an unbelievable facility in Ames that is as beautiful as it is functional. Here are some of my favorite pictures.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Workiva Lobby`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/life-at-workiva/lobby.jpg`}\r\n  width={2250}\r\n  height={1500}\r\n/>\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Workiva Atrium`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/life-at-workiva/atrium.jpg`}\r\n  width={1110}\r\n  height={863}\r\n/>\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Workiva Cafe`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/life-at-workiva/cafe.jpg`}\r\n  width={1110}\r\n  height={740}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and learning more about what I do.

You had just attempted to load a new page only to be greeted with a painful loading spinner. No one likes this experience.\r\n\r\nIt's inevitable that some users of your application will have slow connections. A well thought out design accounts for varying internet speeds and displays a loading state to the user. However, making the user stare at a spinning wheel for an extended period of time can drastically increase bounce rates. What if there was a better way?\r\n\r\n### Skeleton Screens\r\n\r\nSkeleton screens build anticipation for the content that is going to appear whereas loading spinners (and progress bars) put the focus on the wait time that the user has to endure. Apple has agreed with this idea enough to incorporate skeleton screens into their [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/icons-and-images/launch-screen/). They recommend displaying an outline of the initial application without text or any elements that will change. This can improve the feel of any action taking longer than a few hundred milliseconds.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nBy now, you've probably seen some examples of skeleton screens in your daily browsing without even noticing. For example - Facebook shows users gray circles and lines to represent the contents of a post in their timeline.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Facebook Placeholder`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/loading-placeholder-with-sass/facebook.png`}\r\n  width={1045}\r\n  height={680}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nIt's not just Facebook either. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) has also re-designed their layout to use placeholders.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`LinkedIn Placeholder`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/loading-placeholder-with-sass/linkedin.png`}\r\n  width={1618}\r\n  height={1126}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nYou can trick your users into thinking your website loads faster using skeleton screens. Let's look at how you can actually create this effect using some simple HTML and Scss.\r\n\r\n### Building a Placeholder\r\n\r\nFirst, let's create the base structure. In this example, the placeholder is supposed to represent a text area. We'll use [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) (Base - Element - Modifier) naming for our classes.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-input__loading\">\r\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach line should be about the same height as our text. We can use CSS animation to create a pulsating effect.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n&--line {\r\n  height: 10px;\r\n  margin: 10px;\r\n  animation: pulse 1s infinite ease-in-out;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, let's define how our pulse animation should work. We can modify the opacity of the background color using `rgba` to provide an opacity between 0.0 and 1.0.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@keyframes pulse {\r\n  0% {\r\n    background-color: rgba(165, 165, 165, 0.1);\r\n  }\r\n  50% {\r\n    background-color: rgba(165, 165, 165, 0.3);\r\n  }\r\n  100% {\r\n    background-color: rgba(165, 165, 165, 0.1);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe also want to vary the width of each loading line. Let's create a Sass mixin to apply the given content to each nth-child in a list.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@mixin nth-children($points...) {\r\n  @each $point in $points {\r\n    &:nth-child(#{$point}) {\r\n      @content;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can use the newly created mixin to change the width of all 10 children `div` elements.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@include nth-children(1, 5, 9) {\r\n  width: 150px;\r\n}\r\n@include nth-children(2, 6, 10) {\r\n  width: 250px;\r\n}\r\n@include nth-children(3, 7) {\r\n  width: 50px;\r\n}\r\n@include nth-children(4, 8) {\r\n  width: 100px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Final Result 🎉\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Loading Placeholder Final Result`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/loading-placeholder-with-sass/final-result.gif`}\r\n  width={650}\r\n  height={223}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nYou can view the code and a live example on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leerob/pen/XzRzpb?editors=1100). There's also a React library called [react-placeholder](https://github.com/buildo/react-placeholder) that achieves the same effect.\r\n\r\nFurther Reading:\r\n\r\n- [The Nine States of Design](https://medium.com/swlh/the-nine-states-of-design-5bfe9b3d6d85)\r\n- [How the Facebook content placeholder works](https://cloudcannon.com/deconstructions/2014/11/15/facebook-content-placeholder-deconstruction.html)\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Next.js and Mailchimp`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/mailchimp-next-js/banner.png`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={857}\r\n  priority\r\n/>\r\n\r\n_The year is 2030. Everyone has a newsletter. Email has overtaken social media. 95% of coding is done via drag-and-drop tools._\r\n\r\nOkay, most of that probably isn't true. Except the [no-code tools](https://webflow.com/).\r\nUnless you've been living under a rock, you've probably noticed the rise of newsletters (especially in the developer community).\r\n\r\n_Why?_ Well, they're an excellent way to promote content to those who really want to read it. If you've ever thought about starting a newsletter, then you've found the right article 🎉\r\n\r\n## Mailchimp vs. The World\r\n\r\nIf you're just starting a newsletter, you probably want something with a free tier.\r\nThat was my rationale for adopting [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/). It was simple, easy to set up, and didn't require an API route. Perfect!\r\n\r\nHowever, it wasn't exactly a frictionless sign-up process. When a user clicked \"subscribe\", it launched a pop-up window where they had to confirm their email address again.\r\nAgain, _it works_, but we can do better.\r\n\r\nI started to explore using [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) as an alternative. It also has a [free tier](https://mailchimp.com/pricing/) if you have less than 2,000 subscribers. Perfect.\r\n\r\n## Why Next.js?\r\n\r\n[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is the easiest way to build applications in React. One of my favorite features is API routes.\r\n\r\nAPI routes provide a solution for building a complete API inside Next.js.\r\nAll you need to get started is an `api/` folder inside your main `pages/` folder where your routes live.\r\n\r\nEvery file inside `pages/api/` is mapped to `/api/*`. This is where we'll communicate with Mailchimp.\r\nFirst, we need to set up an account.\r\n\r\n## Setting up Mailchimp\r\n\r\nAfter [creating an account](https://mailchimp.com/help/create-an-account/), you'll need to fetch your [API key](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-api-keys/#find+or+generate+your+api+key).\r\n\r\nWhen a user clicks \"subscribe\", we'll want to add their email address to our [audience](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/create-your-first-audience/#add-a-contact-to-an-audience).\r\nWe'll need to grab a few values:\r\n\r\n- The [API server region](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/quick-start/#make-your-first-api-call) (e.g. `us1`).\r\n- The [Audience ID](https://mailchimp.com/help/find-audience-id/) for the mailing list.\r\n\r\n## Environment Variables\r\n\r\nLet's make our secrets we've retrieved available without hardcoding them into our request. Since I'm deploying with [Vercel](https://vercel.com), I'll need to set up some [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).\r\nFirst, let's create `.env.local` for testing locally.\r\n\r\n```bash:.env.local\r\nMAILCHIMP_API_KEY=\r\nMAILCHIMP_API_SERVER=\r\nMAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID=\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, [add these environment variables in Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables) so they're available on pull requests (Preview) and in Production.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Don't forget to add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore`. We don't want to commit our secrets.\r\n\r\n## Creating The Request\r\n\r\nNow that we have our values available as environment variables, we can create an API route at `pages/api/subscribe.js` to add a member to our list.\r\nMake sure you install the `@mailchimp/mailchimp_marketing` library.\r\n\r\n```js:pages/api/subscribe.js\r\nimport mailchimp from '@mailchimp/mailchimp_marketing';\r\n\r\nmailchimp.setConfig({\r\n  apiKey: process.env.MAILCHIMP_API_KEY,\r\n  server: process.env.MAILCHIMP_API_SERVER // e.g. us1\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default async (req, res) => {\r\n  const { email } = req.body;\r\n\r\n  if (!email) {\r\n    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email is required' });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  try {\r\n    await mailchimp.lists.addListMember(process.env.MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID, {\r\n      email_address: email,\r\n      status: 'subscribed'\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return res.status(201).json({ error: '' });\r\n  } catch (error) {\r\n    return res.status(500).json({ error: error.message || error.toString() });\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Creating A Form Input\r\n\r\nNow that our API is created, we need a way to gather user input. Let's create a component to send a request to our API.\r\n\r\n```js:components/Subscribe.js\r\nimport React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';\r\n\r\nfunction Subscribe() {\r\n  // 1. Create a reference to the input so we can fetch/clear it's value.\r\n  const inputEl = useRef(null);\r\n  // 2. Hold a message in state to handle the response from our API.\r\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\r\n\r\n  const subscribe = async (e) => {\r\n    e.preventDefault();\r\n\r\n    // 3. Send a request to our API with the user's email address.\r\n    const res = await fetch('/api/subscribe', {\r\n      body: JSON.stringify({\r\n        email: inputEl.current.value\r\n      }),\r\n      headers: {\r\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json'\r\n      },\r\n      method: 'POST'\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    const { error } = await res.json();\r\n\r\n    if (error) {\r\n      // 4. If there was an error, update the message in state.\r\n      setMessage(error);\r\n\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // 5. Clear the input value and show a success message.\r\n    inputEl.current.value = '';\r\n    setMessage('Success! 🎉 You are now subscribed to the newsletter.');\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <form onSubmit={subscribe}>\r\n      <label htmlFor=\"email-input\">{'Email Address'}</label>\r\n      <input\r\n        id=\"email-input\"\r\n        name=\"email\"\r\n        placeholder=\"you@awesome.com\"\r\n        ref={inputEl}\r\n        required\r\n        type=\"email\"\r\n      />\r\n      <div>\r\n        {message\r\n          ? message\r\n          : `I'll only send emails when new content is posted. No spam.`}\r\n      </div>\r\n      <button type=\"submit\">{'✨ Subscribe 💌'}</button>\r\n    </form>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to see a completed example, the entire source code for my blog is [open source](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/bfbd33a822fbcbbafd4027aa45884446f6f8ff3c/pages/api/subscribe.js).\r\n\r\nCurious if it actually works?

Dark mode support\r\n\r\n## Simplified Design\r\n\r\nBefore this redesign, I hand-rolled all of my components using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).\r\nI was trying to maintain a consistent design, so I'd extract shared values out into a theme.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const colors = {\r\n  accent: '#ff5252',\r\n  background: '#0a6159',\r\n  border: '#dcdcdc',\r\n  grey: {\r\n      100: '#F5F7FA',\r\n      200: '#E4E7EB',\r\n      300: '#CBD2D9',\r\n      400: '#9AA5B1',\r\n      500: '#7B8794',\r\n      600: '#616E7C',\r\n      700: '#52606D',\r\n      800: '#3E4C59',\r\n      900: '#323F4B',\r\n      1000: '#1F2933'\r\n  },\r\n  light: '#606060',\r\n  text: '#101010'\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const spacing = {\r\n  extrasmall: '0.5em',\r\n  small: '1em'\r\n  normal: '1.5em',\r\n  large: '2em',\r\n  extralarge: '2.5em',\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFront-end tooling has rapidly progressed, and projects like [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) and [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) make it easy\r\nto create components that easily adhere to your design system.\r\n\r\nMy site isn't anything crazy – mostly a few simple static pages and blog posts. While coding everything myself is a\r\nfun learning experience, there are plenty of component libraries that contain everything necessary to achieve the\r\ndesign I was aiming for. That's why I chose to adopt [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for my redesign.\r\n\r\n- It uses styled-system under the hood, allowing me to use style props\r\n- The theme is extendable, allowing me to change fonts and add icons easily\r\n- It includes a great set of accessible components out of the box\r\n- Works well with Next.js and supports dark mode\r\n\r\nHere's a quick example of Chakra UI and styled-system. This is part of the source for\r\nthe newsletter subscription at the bottom of this post.\r\n\r\n```js:components/Subscribe.js\r\n<Box\r\n  border=\"1px solid\"\r\n  borderColor=\"blue.200\"\r\n  bg=\"blue.50\"\r\n  borderRadius={4}\r\n  padding={6}\r\n  my={4}\r\n>\r\n  <Heading as=\"h5\" size=\"lg\" mb={2}>\r\n    Subscribe to the newsletter\r\n  </Heading>\r\n  <Text>\r\n    Get emails from me about web development, tech, and early access to new\r\n    articles.\r\n  </Text>\r\n  <InputGroup size=\"md\" mt={4}>\r\n    <Input\r\n      aria-label=\"Email for newsletter\"\r\n      placeholder=\"tim@apple.com\"\r\n      type=\"email\"\r\n    />\r\n    <InputRightElement width=\"6.75rem\">\r\n      <Button fontWeight=\"bold\" h=\"1.75rem\" size=\"sm\">\r\n        Subscribe\r\n      </Button>\r\n    </InputRightElement>\r\n  </InputGroup>\r\n</Box>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing [style props](https://styled-system.com/getting-started), I'm able to easily style my components while pulling values directly from\r\nmy design system. For example, `mb` (short for `margin-bottom`) of `2` will translate to `0.5rem` or `~8px`.\r\n\r\n> **Update 2020:** I've [switched to Tailwind](/blog/tailwind) now.\r\n\r\n## Improved Content Management\r\n\r\nI wanted to decrease the amount of friction it took to create new articles,\r\nas well as improve maintainability over time.\r\n\r\nPreviously, I maintained a JSON file containing all my articles.\r\n\r\n```js:data/articles.json\r\nexport default [\r\n  {\r\n    date: 'February 24, 2020',\r\n    slug: 'fetching-data-with-swr',\r\n    title: 'Create a Dashboard with Next.js API Routes - Fetching Data with SWR'\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    date: 'February 18, 2020',\r\n    slug: 'google-analytics-api-nextjs',\r\n    title: 'Create a Dashboard with Next.js API Routes - Google Analytics API'\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, I iterated over this list to display all articles when viewing `leerob.io/blog`.\r\nThis approach worked, but it meant that I had two sources of truth.\r\n\r\nEach `.mdx` blog post already contained this information, as well as other metadata passed to `<Post />`.\r\nEvery time I added a new article, I had to change two places.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const meta = {\r\n  date: '2019-12-26',\r\n  description: 'Highlights and reflections on 2019 and a look forward to 2020.',\r\n  image: '/static/images/2019/banner.jpg',\r\n  slug: '2019',\r\n  title: '2019 Year in Review'\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default ({ children }) => <Post meta={meta}>{children}</Post>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI decided to use Markdown front matter instead. Now, each `.mdx` file has a top section like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntitle: '2019 Year in Review';\r\npublishedAt: '2019-12-26';\r\nsummary: 'Highlights and reflections on 2019 and a look forward to 2020.';\r\nimage: '/static/images/2019/banner.jpg';\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, I can use native Next.js functionality like `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` to fetch my MDX content:\r\n\r\n```js:pages/blog/[slug].js\r\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\r\n  const posts = await getFiles('blog');\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    paths: posts.map((p) => ({\r\n      params: {\r\n        slug: p.replace(/\\.mdx/, '')\r\n      }\r\n    })),\r\n    fallback: false\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\r\n  const post = await getFileBySlug('blog', params.slug);\r\n\r\n  return { props: { ...post } };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> **Update 2021:** I've moved to [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler).\r\n\r\n## MDX Plugins\r\n\r\n`mdx-bundler` allows you to extend [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype), providing external plugins to hook into the compilation process. Some plugins I've added:\r\n\r\n- [rehype-slug](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug)\r\n- [rehype-code-titles](https://github.com/josestg/rehype-code-title)\r\n- [rehype-autolink-headings](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings)\r\n- [rehype-prism-plus](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-prism-plus)\r\n\r\n```js:lib/mdx.js\r\nimport { join } from 'path';\r\nimport { readFileSync } from 'fs';\r\nimport { bundleMDX } from 'mdx-bundler';\r\nimport readingTime from 'reading-time';\r\n\r\nimport rehypeSlug from 'rehype-slug';\r\nimport rehypeCodeTitles from 'rehype-code-titles';\r\nimport rehypeAutolinkHeadings from 'rehype-autolink-headings';\r\nimport rehypePrism from 'rehype-prism-plus';\r\n\r\nexport async function getFileBySlug(type, slug) {\r\n  const source = readFileSync(join(process.cwd(), 'data', type, `${slug}.mdx`), 'utf8');\r\n  const { code, frontmatter } = await bundleMDX(source, {\r\n    xdmOptions(options) {\r\n      options.rehypePlugins = [\r\n        ...(options?.rehypePlugins ?? []),\r\n        rehypeSlug,\r\n        rehypeCodeTitles,\r\n        rehypePrism,\r\n        [\r\n          rehypeAutolinkHeadings,\r\n          {\r\n            properties: {\r\n              className: ['anchor']\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      ];\r\n      return options;\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    code,\r\n    frontMatter: {\r\n      wordCount: source.split(/\\s+/gu).length,\r\n      readingTime: readingTime(source),\r\n      slug: slug || null,\r\n      ...frontmatter\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis added some nice additional features:\r\n\r\n- Hover over a heading and click on `#` to link directly to it.\r\n- Use `language:title` to add titles to code snippets.\r\n- [Reading time](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reading-time) of articles.\r\n\r\n## Better Syntax Highlighting\r\n\r\nPreviously, I directly imported a `prism.css` theme alongside `react-syntax-highlighter` to provide syntax highlighting.\r\nThis approach did not allow me to easily change styles based on the theme. Thus, I kept the code style always dark.\r\n\r\nInstead, I switched to [rehype-prism-plus](https://github.com/Val-istar-Guo/rehype-prism)\r\nand created two prism themes for dark/light mode. `rehype-prism-plus` also adds line highlighting capabilities 🎉\r\n\r\n```js:styles/prism.js\r\nimport { css } from '@emotion/react';\r\nimport { theme } from '@chakra-ui/react';\r\n\r\nconst prismBaseTheme = css`\r\n  // Base styling\r\n`;\r\n\r\nexport const prismLightTheme = css`\r\n  // Light mode\r\n`;\r\n\r\nexport const prismDarkTheme = css`\r\n  // Dark mode\r\n`;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js:_app.js\r\nconst { colorMode } = useColorMode();\r\nconst prismTheme = colorMode === 'light' ? prismLightTheme : prismDarkTheme;\r\n```\r\n\r\n> **Update 2020:** I've [switched to Tailwind](/blog/tailwind) now and use the native Dark Mode support.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nOutside of my main goals, I was able to sneak in some other fun additions:\r\n\r\n- Show [view counts](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/91233631f0e1a193295ffc54d2291f3109060007/components/BlogPost.tsx) for all blog posts, dynamically pulled from Firebase\r\n- Faster page load times\r\n- Switched to [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) as my main font\r\n- Fewer files, and a _lot_ of deleted code!\r\n\r\nThe best part? [**It's all open source**](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) 🚀\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\nA few weeks ago, I [moved this site](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/pull/326) from using [Firebase](/blog/real-time-post-views) and [Redis](/blog/serverless-redis-nextjs) to PlanetScale. [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com) is a serverless database platform built on MySQL and Vitess. Here's why I picked PlanetScale:\r\n\r\n- **Database Branching:** I'm able to use my database with the same mental model as git. For each change to my database schema, I open a deploy request. Then, I can merge those changes back into my main database branch.\r\n- **Prisma Support:** In combination with Prisma, it's _so easy_ to handle database migrations. I haven't moved to Prisma (yet) but will soon.\r\n- **Connectionless:** Since PlanetScale is serverless, it's built to withstand thousands of simultaneous connections. You can almost consider this _connectionless_ – the developer doesn't need to worry about [pooling or other common objections](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1430177168307412998).\r\n- **Insanely Fast:** After testing 13 databases, PlanetScale was the [fastest to deploy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmYHn82cY8). Now, after using it for a few weeks and monitoring performance, I'm seeing APIs resolve in `~150ms` on average (see [results](#results) below).\r\n\r\nI had a chance to talk with [Nick from PlanetScale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqBG5rFP4Ic) on a stream last month if you want to see a live demo of the workflow.\r\n\r\n## Why Firebase and Redis?\r\n\r\nThis site previously used [Firebase](/blog/real-time-post-views) and [Redis](/blog/serverless-redis-nextjs) for real-time blog post views and [my guestbook](/guestbook). The primary decision for choosing these technologies was to learn. I learn best by experimenting and building. I even [created a course](https://react2025.com/) showing how to use Firebase with Next.js, if you're interested.\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1434355662935314432\" />\r\n\r\nBoth Firebase and Redis (through [Upstash](https://upstash.com/)) are easy to get started, scale without thinking, and work great in serverless environments. However, I wanted to move to something [SQL-based](/blog/backend) (either MySQL or PostgreSQL) for a new learning experience. I've previously written about [choosing your backend](/blog/backend) and landed on PlanetScale.\r\n\r\n## Rebuilding SQL\r\n\r\nI found myself writing JavaScript in places where SQL has the functionality built-in. For example, I used Firebase to fetch a JSON object `views` and then summed the values together to find the total number of views.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst snapshot = await db.ref('views').once('value');\r\nconst views = snapshot.val();\r\nconst allViews = Object.values(views).reduce((total, value) => total + value);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith SQL, you can use `SUM()` instead. Easier? Yeah. Better? Probably debatable, but I like it.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT SUM(count) as total\r\nFROM views;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSame thing with sorting. Before I was using JavaScript `sort` and now I can use `ORDER BY`. Firebase does have [something similar](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/order-limit-data), I just wasn't using it.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM guestbook\r\nORDER BY updated_at DESC;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Why MySQL and PlanetScale?\r\n\r\nSQL is boring, proven technology. It's been around for years and will continue to be around for years. I've used it before in prior jobs, but still felt I could understand it better. I also enjoy using PostgreSQL (and recommend Supabase) and strongly considered that solution as well. I'm planning to build a different project with Supabase soon.\r\n\r\nI'm also a strong believer in using tools I recommend. Without actually getting my hands dirty in code and running an application in production, it's hard to confidently recommend a product to others. After using the [PlanetScale Vercel Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/planetscale), I was blown away. I could deploy an entire fullstack application in a few clicks. And as I mentioned at the start, database migrations aligned with my mental model.\r\n\r\n<StaticTweet id=\"1426215788407627784\" />\r\n\r\n## Migrating Existing Data\r\n\r\nThere are likely better ways to do this, but my hacky solution to migrate data into PlanetScale was as follows:\r\n\r\n- Export JSON data from my Firebase Realtime Database\r\n\r\n  <Image\r\n    alt={`Exporting data from Firebase`}\r\n    src={`/static/images/mysql-planetscale/firebase.png`}\r\n    width={2905 / 2}\r\n    height={1959 / 2}\r\n  />\r\n\r\n- Export JSON data from my Redis cluster using `HVALS` and TablePlus\r\n\r\n  <Image\r\n    alt={`Exporting data from my Redis cluster`}\r\n    src={`/static/images/mysql-planetscale/redis.png`}\r\n    width={2540 / 2}\r\n    height={1852 / 2}\r\n  />\r\n\r\n- Create a new database branch in PlanetScale for the schema migration adding the tables\r\n- Create two new API routes, which loaded the JSON data and `INSERT INTO` MySQL\r\n- Verify on the database branch the APIs correctly process and migrate the data\r\n- Create a deploy request with the new schema changes and merge it into `main`\r\n- Finally, hit the APIs to migrate the JSON data into `main`\r\n- Done!\r\n\r\nHere are the two scripts I used, for reference.\r\n\r\n```jsx:pages/api/migrate-redis.js\r\nimport db from 'lib/planetscale';\r\nimport guestbookData from 'data/guestbook';\r\n\r\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\r\n  const toISOString = (unixTimestampInMs) =>\r\n    new Date(unixTimestampInMs).toJSON().slice(0, 19).replace('T', ' ');\r\n\r\n  let query = `INSERT INTO guestbook (email, updated_at, body, created_by)\r\n    VALUES `;\r\n\r\n  const escapeStr = (str) =>\r\n    str\r\n      .replace(/\\\\/g, '\\\\\\\\')\r\n      .replace(/\\$/g, '\\\\$')\r\n      .replace(/'/g, \"\\\\'\")\r\n      .replace(/\"/g, '\\\\\"');\r\n\r\n  guestbookData.forEach((item, key) => {\r\n    var value = JSON.parse(item['value']);\r\n\r\n    query += `(\"${\r\n      value.email ? `${value.email}` : 'not@provided.com'\r\n    }\", \"${toISOString(value.updated_at)}\", \"${escapeStr(value.body)}\", \"${\r\n      value.created_by\r\n    }\")`;\r\n\r\n    if (key === guestbookData.length - 1) {\r\n      query += ';';\r\n    } else {\r\n      query += ', ';\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  const [rows] = await db.query(query);\r\n\r\n  return res.status(201).json(rows[0]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```jsx:pages/api/migrate-firebase.js\r\nimport db from 'lib/planetscale';\r\nimport viewsData from 'data/views';\r\n\r\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\r\n  let query = `INSERT INTO views (slug, count)\r\n    VALUES `;\r\n\r\n  const slugs = Object.keys(viewsData['views']);\r\n\r\n  slugs.forEach((slug, key) => {\r\n    const count = viewsData['views'][slug];\r\n\r\n    query += `(\"${slug}\", ${count})`;\r\n\r\n    if (key === slugs.length - 1) {\r\n      query += ';';\r\n    } else {\r\n      query += ', ';\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  const [rows] = await db.query(query);\r\n\r\n  return res.status(201).json(rows[0]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's my PlanetScale schema for tracking post views and guestbook entries.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE `views` (\r\n  `slug` varchar(128) NOT NULL,\r\n  `count` bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT '1',\r\n  PRIMARY KEY (`slug`)\r\n)\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE `guestbook` (\r\n  `id` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\r\n  `email` varchar(256) NOT NULL,\r\n  `body` varchar(500) NOT NULL,\r\n  `created_by` varchar(256) NOT NULL,\r\n  `created_at` datetime(6) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6),\r\n  `updated_at` datetime(6) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6),\r\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\nI've been monitoring the performance of my production APIs connecting to PlanetScale with [Checkly](https://www.checklyhq.com). Checkly allows me to set alerts if there's downtime or if performance decreases below my accepted threshold. For the last week, I've seen latency of `~150ms` for my Next.js API Routes, deployed as serverless functions on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) in `us-east`.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Checkly results from PlanetScale database`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/mysql-planetscale/checkly.png`}\r\n  width={1490}\r\n  height={528}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThis has been significantly faster than my previous Firebase implementation.

      "raw": "\r\nStatic sites are all the rage – and for a good reason. They have many benefits:\r\n\r\n- Globally scalable\r\n- Cheaper by hosting static files\r\n- Faster performance by serving cached assets from a CDN\r\n- No need to worry about server or database vulnerabilities\r\n- Better developer experience – no complicated deployment process\r\n\r\nLet's learn how to build a static site with Next.js and Prisma.\r\n\r\n> Note: This post is also available in [Korean](https://velog.io/@sirl/Next.js-9.3%EA%B3%BC-Prisma%EB%A1%9C-%EC%A0%95%EC%A0%81-%EC%9B%B9%ED%8E%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%A7%80-%EB%A7%8C%EB%93%A4%EA%B8%B0).\r\n\r\n## Next.js 9.3\r\n\r\nBefore 9.3, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) was mostly used for server-side rendered (SSR) React apps.\r\nIt solved a few common issues with most client-side rendered (CSR) React apps,\r\nincluding search engine optimization (SEO), routing, and code splitting. There was only one issue.\r\nSSR requires, well... a server. This limits your deployment options and increases costs.\r\nThat's where Next.js 9.3 came in.\r\n\r\nWith the release of 9.3, Next.js is now a complete static-site generator (SSG). Using two new\r\nNext.js functions `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`, we can take _dynamic_ data\r\nand build **static** sites. Incredible!\r\n\r\nHere's the special sauce: `getStaticProps` is only ran at build time – it's\r\nnot even included in the browser JS bundle.\r\nThat means you can write server-side code directly, including direct database queries.\r\nEnter Prisma.\r\n\r\n## Prisma\r\n\r\n[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) makes database access easy.\r\nWith auto-generated and type-safe queries based on your database schema,\r\nit's easier than ever to manage your data.\r\nWhether you have an existing database or you're starting from scratch, Prisma has you covered.\r\nIt currently supports MySQL, SQLite, and Postgres. For this tutorial, I'll be using SQLite.\r\n\r\nWhen combining Prisma with Next.js 9.3, you can skip the\r\ncreate/update/delete API boilerplate and directly query the database.\r\nLess code means less bugs.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nOkay, enough talking. Let's build an app! Here's the [final result](https://prisma-next.now.sh/).\r\n\r\n- The entire site is static and can be hosted anywhere\r\n- Data is read from the database at build time\r\n- Pages are dynamically built (e.g., `/songs/[id]`)\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Next.js and Prisma`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/next-prisma/prisma.gif`}\r\n  width={830}\r\n  height={489}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nBefore continuing, you'll need to have\r\n[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 10 or higher) installed on your machine.\r\n\r\n## Download Starter\r\n\r\nTo save you time, I've already configured the Prisma schema and database\r\nwe'll need for this tutorial. Don't worry, I'll explain them! First, clone the\r\nrepository and install the dependencies.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/leerob/next-prisma-starter.git\r\n$ cd next-prisma-starter\r\n$ yarn\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis includes a few important files.\r\n\r\n- `prisma/schema.prisma`: [Prisma schema file](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/prisma-schema-file) defining your models\r\n- `prisma/dev.db`: A SQLite database file containing song/artist data\r\n\r\n## Prisma Schema & Database\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at our database schema.\r\n\r\nWe have two models: `Song` and `Artist`. A `Song` includes\r\nsome necessary information like the `name` as well as a relation to an `Artist`.\r\nFor the sake of this example, a `Song` can only have one `Artist`.\r\n\r\n```js:prisma/schema.prisma\r\ndatasource db {\r\n  provider = \"sqlite\"\r\n  url      = \"file:dev.db\"\r\n}\r\n\r\ngenerator client {\r\n  provider = \"prisma-client-js\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodel Song {\r\n  id            Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id\r\n  name          String\r\n  artist        Artist? @relation(fields: [artistId], references: [id])\r\n  artistId      Int?\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodel Artist {\r\n  id    Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id\r\n  name  String  @unique\r\n  songs Song[]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've pre-populated the `dev.db` with some songs and artists.\r\n\r\n| id                |      name       |   artist   | artistId |\r\n| :---------------- | :-------------: | :--------: | -------: |\r\n| NJ                | Chelsea Cutler  | `[Artist]` |        1 |\r\n| Take It Easy      |    Surfaces     | `[Artist]` |        2 |\r\n| always, i'll care |  Jeremy Zucker  | `[Artist]` |        3 |\r\n| Heartless         |   The Weeknd    | `[Artist]` |        4 |\r\n| Daphne Blue       | The Band CAMINO | `[Artist]` |        5 |\r\n\r\n## Querying Data\r\n\r\nWe have a database and some sample data. Let's build a landing page\r\nto display all of the songs. Navigate to `pages/index.js`.\r\nThis is the entry point of your application.\r\n\r\nThis file sets up the boilerplate for `getStaticProps` to\r\nallow us to query the database for our songs. Then, we\r\niterate over our results and display them as a list.\r\n\r\n```js:pages/index.js\r\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\r\n  return {\r\n    props: {\r\n      songs: [\r\n        {\r\n          id: 1,\r\n          name: 'Test Song'\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ({ songs }) => (\r\n  <ul>\r\n    {songs.map((song) => (\r\n      <li key={song.id}>{song.name}</li>\r\n    ))}\r\n  </ul>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, let's get some real data on the screen. After adding the Prisma\r\nclient, we can fetch all songs using `findMany`. One of the best features of Prisma\r\nis how simple it makes working with relations. We can retrieve the corresponding\r\n`Artist` for the `Song` using `include`.\r\n\r\n```js {1,4,5,6,7}:pages/index.js\r\nimport { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\r\n\r\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\r\n  const prisma = new PrismaClient();\r\n  const songs = await prisma.song.findMany({\r\n    include: { artist: true }\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    props: {\r\n      songs\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ({ songs }) => (\r\n  <ul>\r\n    {songs.map((song) => (\r\n      <li key={song.id}>{song.name}</li>\r\n    ))}\r\n  </ul>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen Next.js compiles your page, it will query the database and display\r\nall the songs as a list. Static site, dynamic data!\r\n\r\n## Database Migrations & Editing Data\r\n\r\nA list of songs is great, but what if we want more? Let's say we want to\r\ninclude the music video on YouTube for each song. This will require changes\r\nto the database. Don't worry – Prisma has you covered 😎\r\n\r\n[Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-migrate) is a tool that lets you change your database schema,\r\ne.g. by creating new tables or adding columns to existing tables.\r\nThese changes are called _schema migrations_.\r\n\r\nPrisma Migrate generates `.sql` migration files which you can apply to your database.\r\n\r\nLet's add some new fields to our schema.\r\n\r\n```js {13,14}:prisma/schema.prisma\r\ndatasource db {\r\n  provider = \"sqlite\"\r\n  url      = \"file:dev.db\"\r\n}\r\n\r\ngenerator client {\r\n  provider = \"prisma-client-js\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodel Song {\r\n  id            Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id\r\n  name          String\r\n  youtubeId     String?\r\n  albumCoverUrl String?\r\n  artist        Artist? @relation(fields: [artistId], references: [id])\r\n  artistId      Int?\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodel Artist {\r\n  id    Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id\r\n  name  String  @unique\r\n  songs Song[]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's create and run the migration:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npx prisma migrate dev --preview-feature\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates a `migration.sql` file and runs it against your database.\r\nFinally, we need to update our Prisma Client API (`node_modules/@prisma/client`)\r\nto recognize the new changes.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npx prisma generate\r\n```\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Prisma Flow`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/next-prisma/prisma-flow.png`}\r\n  width={1600}\r\n  height={842}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n**That's it!** You now have two new fields available on the `Song` model.\r\nNow, let's update our database and populate those values.\r\nThere's a variety of ways to do this:\r\n\r\n1. Good ol' fashioned SQL commands\r\n1. Run a Node.js script invoking the Prisma client\r\n1. Use a visual editor to modify the database\r\n\r\nI don't know about you, but #3 seems the easiest to me.\r\nLuckily, Prisma has another fancy tool called Prisma Studio that allows us to do just that.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npx prisma studio --experimental\r\n```\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Prisma Studio`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/next-prisma/studio.gif`}\r\n  width={983}\r\n  height={537}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nFor convenience, I've added these commands as scripts in the `package.json` already.\r\n\r\n```json:package.json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"db\": \"prisma studio --experimental\",\r\n    \"db-save\": \"prisma migrate save --experimental\",\r\n    \"db-up\": \"prisma migrate up --experimental\",\r\n    \"generate\": \"prisma generate\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Dynamic Routes\r\n\r\nNow that we know each song's YouTube video, let's create a page\r\nfor each song. Using Next.js, we can use brackets to denote\r\na dynamic route (e.g., `pages/songs/[id].js`)\r\n\r\nOnce again, I've included the page boilerplate to use `getStaticPaths`\r\nand `getStaticProps`. Try navigating to `/songs/1` in your browser.\r\nYou should see a YouTube video.\r\n\r\n```js:pages/songs/[id].js\r\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\r\n  return {\r\n    props: {\r\n      song: {\r\n        youtubeId: 'N6SQ9QoSjCI'\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\r\n  return {\r\n    paths: [\r\n      {\r\n        params: {\r\n          id: '1'\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    fallback: false\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ({ song }) => (\r\n  <iframe\r\n    width=\"100%\"\r\n    height=\"315\"\r\n    src={`https://www.youtube.com/embed/${song.youtubeId}`}\r\n    frameBorder=\"0\"\r\n    allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\r\n    allowFullScreen\r\n  />\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, let's hook this up to real data.\r\n\r\n- `getStaticProps` will query song data for the given `id`\r\n- `getStaticPaths` will generate a page for each song in the database\r\n\r\n```js {1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,14,20,21,24,25,26,27}:pages/songs/[id].js\r\nimport { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\r\n\r\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\r\n  const prisma = new PrismaClient();\r\n  const song = await prisma.song.findOne({\r\n    include: { artist: true },\r\n    where: {\r\n      id: Number(params.id)\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    props: {\r\n      song\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\r\n  const prisma = new PrismaClient();\r\n  const songs = await prisma.song.findMany();\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    paths: songs.map((song) => ({\r\n      params: {\r\n        id: song.id.toString()\r\n      }\r\n    })),\r\n    fallback: false\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ({ song }) => (\r\n  <iframe\r\n    width=\"100%\"\r\n    height=\"315\"\r\n    src={`https://www.youtube.com/embed/${song.youtubeId}`}\r\n    frameBorder=\"0\"\r\n    allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\r\n    allowFullScreen\r\n  />\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry going to `/songs/4` – we're now pulling from the database!\r\n\r\n## Deployment\r\n\r\nDeploying static sites couldn't be easier with [Vercel](https://vercel.com).\r\nAfter installing the Vercel CLI, simply run `vercel` in the root of the project.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ vercel\r\n```\r\n\r\n**That's it**.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nNext.js 9.3 and Prisma are a fantastic combo. The combination of dynamic data\r\nand static sites result in an incredible user experience.\r\n\r\nTo see the completed tutorial code with styles added,\r\ncheck out my [next-prisma](https://github.com/leerob/next-prisma) repo.

      "raw": "\r\nThis guide will show you how to use Firebase 9+ with Next.js and deploy it to Vercel.\r\n\r\n### Connecting to Firebase\r\n\r\n1. Create a project in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart).\r\n1. In the Firebase console, open Settings > Service Accounts.\r\n1. Click Generate New Private Key, then confirm by clicking Generate Key.\r\n1. Download and open the JSON file containing your service account.\r\n1. Create a new file `.env.local` and add environment variables with those values.\r\n\r\n```bash:.env.local\r\nNEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=replace-me\r\nFIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=replace-me\r\nFIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=replace-me\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate `lib/firebase.js` to connect to Firebase using your credentials:\r\n\r\n```js:lib/firebase.js\r\nimport * as admin from 'firebase-admin';\r\n\r\nif (!admin.apps.length) {\r\n  admin.initializeApp({\r\n    credential: admin.credential.cert({\r\n      projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,\r\n      clientEmail: process.env.FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL,\r\n      privateKey: process.env.FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY.replace(/\\\\n/g, '\\n')\r\n    })\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst db = admin.firestore();\r\n\r\nexport { db };\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Fetching Data from Firebase\r\n\r\nWe can fetch data on the server from Firebase using an [API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) in Next.js. You'll need to create a new collection `users` and add a document `leerob` with a `name` string field if you're following this guide, but you can change that to whatever you want.\r\n\r\n```js:pages/api/user.js\r\nimport { db } from '../../lib/firebase';\r\n\r\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\r\n  const user = await db.collection('users').doc('leerob').get();\r\n\r\n  if (!user.exists) {\r\n    return res.status(404).json({});\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return res.status(404).json({ id: user.id, ...user.data() });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's break this down:\r\n\r\n1. You'll make a request to `/api/users` from your frontend\r\n1. A connection to Firestore is created using your service account\r\n1. The API Route queries the `users` collection and returns the `leerob` document\r\n1. We return the data for that document in the response\r\n\r\n### Displaying Data on the Client\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to install the correct dependencies:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm i swr next@latest react@rc react-dom@rc\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, let's make a request to our API Route on the client-side using [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) and Suspense:\r\n\r\n```js:pages/index.js\r\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\r\nimport useSWR from 'swr';\r\n\r\nconst fetcher = async (...args) => {\r\n  const res = await fetch(...args);\r\n\r\n  return res.json();\r\n};\r\n\r\nfunction Profile() {\r\n  const { data } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher, { suspense: true });\r\n  return <div>Hello, {data.name}!</div>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default function App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\r\n      <Profile />\r\n    </Suspense>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's break this down:\r\n\r\n1. When you request the root route (`/`) in your application, `pages/index.js` is rendered\r\n1. React suspends the rendering of the page while fetching from `/api/user`\r\n1. The fallback state (`<div>Loading...</div>`) is rendered while the data is being fetched\r\n1. After the data is fetched, the fallback state is removed and the page is re-rendered\r\n1. The `<Profile />` component shows `Hello, Lee Robinson!`\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\n- [View the code](https://github.com/leerob/nextjs-vercel-firebase)\r\n- [View the demo](https://nextjs-vercel-firebase.vercel.app/)\r\n- [Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fleerob%2Fnextjs-vercel-firebase&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL,FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY&project-name=nextjs-firebase&repo-name=nextjs-firebase)\r\n\r\nRelated articles:\r\n\r\n- [Real-Time Blog Post Views With Next.js and Firebase](/blog/real-time-post-views)\r\n- [Which Back End Should I Use As A Front-End Developer?](/blog/backend)\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\nThere's never been a [better time](/blog/learn-nextjs) to learn React.\r\nIf you're just getting started, you might have heard about these three options:\r\n\r\n- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)\r\n- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)\r\n- [Create React App (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev/)\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not exactly clear when or why you would choose one over the other.\r\nThis post will highlight the key similarities and differences between the three solutions.\r\n\r\n## Next.js\r\n\r\nNext.js is a hybrid React framework that evolves with your product.\r\nWith Next, you can have static pages, server-rendered pages, and more all within the same framework.\r\n\r\n> **Update (2020):** I now work at Vercel, so I'm biased towards Next.js. The cons listed below are the\r\n> most common pain points from the community.\r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n\r\n- ✅ Supports static sites and server-side rendering\r\n- ✅ Best DX out of the three (Webpack support, Fast Refresh, error handling)\r\n- ✅ Create full-stack apps with [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n\r\n- ⛔️ Lack of built-in support for layouts\r\n- ⛔️ Limited plugin system ([RFC](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/9133))\r\n- ⛔️ Server-rendering adds complexity\r\n\r\n## Gatsby\r\n\r\nThe key difference between Next.js and Gatsby is that Gatsby doesn't use a server.\r\nWhile Gatsby's main use case is for static sites, it can also re-hydrate into a fully-functional React application.\r\n\r\nGatsby comes bundled with GraphQL for data fetching. Here's a short example.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport { graphql } from 'gatsby';\r\n\r\nconst HomePage = ({ data }) => {\r\n  return <div>{data.site.siteMetadata.description}</div>;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const query = graphql`\r\n  query HomePageQuery {\r\n    site {\r\n      siteMetadata {\r\n        description\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n`;\r\n\r\nexport default HomePage;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use [Gatsby without GraphQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/using-gatsby-without-graphql/) if you absolutely must, but it's one of the key features it promotes.\r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n\r\n- ✅ Robust [plugin library](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/)\r\n- ✅ GraphQL integration\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n\r\n- ⛔️ GraphQL knowledge potentially needed\r\n- ⛔️ Debugging plugin issues can be difficult\r\n- ⛔️ Potentially large build times (e.g. lots of images/fetches)\r\n\r\n## Create React App\r\n\r\nCRA helps you get started building React apps immediately with client-side rendering (CSR). There's much less to digest and understand.\r\nUnfortunately, that also means there's less you get for free as you scale your application. When building large-scale React applications,\r\nespecially those with marketing pages, having server-rendering in the framework is very helpful.\r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n\r\n- ✅ Easiest to learn\r\n- ✅ Best choice for guaranteed single-page applications\r\n- ✅ More hosting options (since a server isn't required)\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n\r\n- ⛔️ No server-side rendering\r\n- ⛔️ No code-splitting out of the box ([can be configured](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/code-splitting/))\r\n- ⛔️ Requires client-side routing library (e.g. React Router)\r\n- ⛔️ \"Ejecting\" for custom use cases can add complexity\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nStill not sure which one to choose? I would highly recommend reading [Rendering on the Web](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web) for a deep-dive on where your rendering logic should live.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Rendering on the Web`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/nextjs-gatsby-create-react-app/rendering.png`}\r\n  width={2164}\r\n  height={1434}\r\n/>\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\nTo improve your Search Engine Optimization (SEO), you might need to add a sitemap or `robots.txt` file to your Next.js site.\r\n\r\nA **sitemap** defines the relationship between pages of your site. Search engines utilize\r\nthis file to more accurately index your site. You can also provide additional information\r\nsuch as last updated time, how frequently the page changes, and more.\r\n\r\nA **robots.txt** file tells search engines which pages or files the crawler can or can't request from your site.\r\n\r\n## Static Sitemaps\r\n\r\nIf your site does not update frequently, you might currently have a static sitemap.\r\nThis is a basic `.xml` file defining the content of your site. Here's a simple example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\">\r\n  <url>\r\n      <loc>https://leerob.io</loc>\r\n  </url>\r\n  <url>\r\n      <loc>https://leerob.io/blog</loc>\r\n  </url>\r\n</urlset>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs your site scales, you will probably want to create your sitemap dynamically.\r\n\r\n## Dynamic Sitemaps\r\n\r\nIf your site frequently changes, you should dynamically create a sitemap.\r\nLet's first look at an example where your site content is file-based (e.g., contained inside the `/pages` directory).\r\n\r\nFirst, let's add `globby` so we can fetch a list of routes.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ yarn add --dev globby\r\n```\r\n\r\n> **Note:** `globby` [might not work](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/issues/293) on Windows.\r\n\r\nNext, we can create a Node script at `scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs`.\r\nThis file will dynamically build a sitemap based on your `/pages` directory.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { writeFileSync } from 'fs';\r\nimport { globby } from 'globby';\r\nimport prettier from 'prettier';\r\n\r\nasync function generate() {\r\n  const prettierConfig = await prettier.resolveConfig('./.prettierrc.js');\r\n  const pages = await globby([\r\n    'pages/*.js',\r\n    'data/**/*.mdx',\r\n    '!data/*.mdx',\r\n    '!pages/_*.js',\r\n    '!pages/api',\r\n    '!pages/404.js'\r\n  ]);\r\n\r\n  const sitemap = `\r\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n    <urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\">\r\n        ${pages\r\n          .map((page) => {\r\n            const path = page\r\n              .replace('pages', '')\r\n              .replace('data', '')\r\n              .replace('.js', '')\r\n              .replace('.mdx', '');\r\n            const route = path === '/index' ? '' : path;\r\n\r\n            return `\r\n              <url>\r\n                  <loc>${`https://leerob.io${route}`}</loc>\r\n              </url>\r\n            `;\r\n          })\r\n          .join('')}\r\n    </urlset>\r\n    `;\r\n\r\n  const formatted = prettier.format(sitemap, {\r\n    ...prettierConfig,\r\n    parser: 'html'\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // eslint-disable-next-line no-sync\r\n  writeFileSync('public/sitemap.xml', formatted);\r\n}\r\n\r\ngenerate();\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, add `postbuild` script in your `package.json` to run this script after `next build` completes.\r\nYour generated file gets created at `public/sitemap.xml` which is then accessible from the root of your site.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\r\n    \"postbuild\": \"node ./scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs\",\r\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\r\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\r\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## External Content\r\n\r\nIf you have externally hosted data (e.g., a CMS), you'll need to make an API request\r\nbefore you can create your sitemap. This implementation will vary depending on your data source,\r\nbut the idea is the same. To demonstrate, I've created an example using placeholder data.\r\n\r\nFirst, create a new file at `pages/sitemap.xml.js`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass Sitemap extends React.Component {\r\n  static async getInitialProps({ res }) {\r\n    const request = await fetch(EXTERNAL_DATA_URL);\r\n    const posts = await request.json();\r\n\r\n    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/xml');\r\n    res.write(createSitemap(posts));\r\n    res.end();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Sitemap;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the route `/sitemap.xml` is initially loaded, we will fetch posts from an external data source\r\nand then write an XML file as the response.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst EXTERNAL_DATA_URL = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts';\r\n\r\nconst createSitemap = (posts) => `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n    <urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\">\r\n        ${posts\r\n          .map(({ id }) => {\r\n            return `\r\n                <url>\r\n                    <loc>${`${EXTERNAL_DATA_URL}/${id}`}</loc>\r\n                </url>\r\n            `;\r\n          })\r\n          .join('')}\r\n    </urlset>\r\n    `;\r\n\r\nclass Sitemap extends React.Component {\r\n  static async getInitialProps({ res }) {\r\n    const request = await fetch(EXTERNAL_DATA_URL);\r\n    const posts = await request.json();\r\n\r\n    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/xml');\r\n    res.write(createSitemap(posts));\r\n    res.end();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Sitemap;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a condensed example of the output.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\">\r\n  <url>\r\n      <loc>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1</loc>\r\n  </url>\r\n  <url>\r\n      <loc>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2</loc>\r\n  </url>\r\n</urlset>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## robots.txt\r\n\r\nFinally, we can create a static file at `public/robots.txt` to define which\r\nfiles can be crawled and where the sitemap is located.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nSitemap: https://leerob.io/sitemap.xml\r\n```\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\nReact was introduced in May 2013. Its paradigm shift was that **your UI was a function of your state**. Given some component state, React can determine what your component will look like. React is _built_ upon the idea of state. However, state has long been one of the most difficult parts of building a React application.\r\n\r\nLet's imagine state management in React as a rugged tool belt. You've used this tool belt for years, slowly adding new tools as needed. Each tool serves a very specific purpose. You don't use your hammer to screw in bolts. As a craftsman, you've learned the right time and place to use each tool.\r\n\r\n**State management with React is a rugged tool belt, but not everyone has the prior experience to know which tool to reach for.** This post will explain the past, present, and future of state management to help you make the correct decision for your team, project, or organization.\r\n\r\n## Glossary\r\n\r\nBefore we begin, it's critical you understand some of the terms commonly used. These aren't the canonical names. A few different variations of each float around, but the underlying ideas are the same:\r\n\r\n- UI State – State used for controlling interactive parts of our application (e.g. dark mode toggle, modals).\r\n- Server Cache State – State from the server, which we cache on the client-side for quick access (e.g. call an API, store the result, use it in multiple places).\r\n- Form State – The many different states of a form (e.g. loading, submitting, disabled, validation, retrying). There's also [controlled & uncontrolled form state](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html).\r\n- URL State – State managed by the browser (e.g. filter products, saving to query parameters, and refreshing the page to see the same products filtered)\r\n- State Machine – An explicit model of your state over time (e.g. a stoplight goes from green → yellow → red, but never green → red).\r\n\r\n## Past\r\n\r\nReact's component model helped create reusable, composable applications. Each component had its own local state. As web apps became more complex, new solutions emerged to more easily share logic between components.\r\n\r\n### Timeline\r\n\r\nTo help you understand how state management has evolved over time, here's a rough timeline of popular state management solutions in React. This list is heavily focused on UI State. This list is not comprehensive, but is enough to give context.\r\n\r\n- 2013 – Introduction\r\n- 2014 – Flux (many libraries)\r\n- 2015 – Redux\r\n- 2016 – MobX\r\n- 2018 – Context\r\n- 2019 – Hooks Introduced (+ React Query, SWR)\r\n- 2019 – Zustand\r\n- 2019 – xState\r\n- 2020 – Jotai, Recoil, Valtio\r\n- 2021 – useSelectedContext\r\n\r\nJust because an item is listed on this timeline does not mean you need to learn it. More on this later. Let's dive into the history of state management in React.\r\n\r\n### Redux\r\n\r\n[Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) was originally created as an implementation of the \"[Flux Architecture](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/#redux-was-built-as-a-flux-architecture-implementation)\", which was a pattern first suggested by Facebook in 2014. Redux came out in 2015 and quickly became the most popular of many Flux-inspired libraries. It's ecosystem of tools and libraries encapsulated both UI state and server caching state. **Redux is still extremely popular and widely used.**\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Redux Growth`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/react-state-management/redux.png`}\r\n  width={1000}\r\n  height={586}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Server Caching State\r\n\r\nIn the early days of React, lots of state management boiled down to fetching data from APIs and caching it for use across the application. The community leaned heavily on libraries like Redux because there wasn't an easy, widely used way to manage _just_ the server cache state.\r\n\r\nWith the release of [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html), encapsulating logic into shared hooks became much easier and accessible. Libraries like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) and [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) emerged to solve this problem specifically.\r\n\r\nYou might think \"Why have a separate library just for server caching state?\". Well, **caching is hard**. Server caching state solves different problems than UI state. Here's a shortlist of some of the things these libraries handle for you:\r\n\r\n- Polling on interval\r\n- Revalidation on focus\r\n- Revalidation on network recovery\r\n- Local mutation (Optimistic UI)\r\n- Smart error retrying\r\n- Pagination and scroll position recovery\r\n\r\nDo you want to implement those yourself? _Probably not._\r\n\r\n### React Context\r\n\r\nWith [v16.3](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/29/react-v-16-3.html), React Context gave us a first-party solution to share logic between components. This also prevented passing values down as props through multiple levels of nested components (i.e. \"[prop-drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling)\").\r\n\r\nReact Context itself is [not state management](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2021/01/context-redux-differences/). It can, however, [be paired with hooks](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react) like `useReducer` to become a state management solution. This combination solved UI state for many common use cases.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`React Context`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/react-state-management/context.png`}\r\n  width={1000}\r\n  height={572}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Present\r\n\r\nIn 2021, there are various ways to handle state management in React. As the community has grown to understand the different types of state, more granular libraries have been created solving very specific use cases.\r\n\r\n### State Machines\r\n\r\nLet's consider a switch statement. If the value of `state` matches any `case`, the corresponding code runs. There's a finite set of cases. This is the most simple state machine – an explicit model of your state.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nswitch (state) {\r\n  case state === 'loading':\r\n    // show loading spinner\r\n    break;\r\n  case state === 'success':\r\n    // show success message\r\n    break;\r\n  default:\r\n  // show error message\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Finite State Machines](https://xstate.js.org/docs/about/concepts.html#finite-state-machines) and [Statecharts](https://xstate.js.org/docs/about/concepts.html#statecharts) are fundamental Computer Science concepts, so this isn't anything React specific. You can turn [`useReducer`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) into a state machine without any third-party libraries.\r\n\r\nState Machines are well-adopted everywhere, including databases, electronics, cars, and more. As state management evolved in the React ecosystem, we realized these old ideas could solve modern state management issues. State Machines are most prevalent for solving form state.\r\n\r\nWith a Finite State Machine, you have a finite number of states your application or component could be in. In practice, State Machines help you uncover bugs as you're required to think through and define edge cases. For much more information on this, I'd recommend checking out the [xState](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) docs or watching [this course](https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-state-machines-using-xstate). You can also [visualize entire state machines online](https://xstate.js.org/viz/).\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`State Machines`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/react-state-management/state-machines.gif`}\r\n  width={800}\r\n  height={277}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Zustand, Recoil, Jotai, Valtio, Oh My!\r\n\r\nWhy do so many different libraries for React state management even exist?\r\n\r\nLet's consider Figma (or any other design tool). You have a toolbar of controls that affect other elements outside of its \"local\" state, or where the component is rendered.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Figma`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/react-state-management/figma.png`}\r\n  width={1000}\r\n  height={663}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nAs you can imagine, an application of this scale would require a complex state management solution. Performance and frame rate are critical for a good user experience here, so you want control over when & how to re-render. Unique use cases like this have led to lots of exploration in the state management space.\r\n\r\nTo summarize the differences between these libraries, let's hear from [Daishi Kato](https://twitter.com/dai_shi/status/1348257768130560008):\r\n\r\n- **Valtio** uses proxies to provide a mutation-style API\r\n- **Jotai** is optimized for \"computed values\" and async actions\r\n- **Zustand** is a very thin library specifically focused on module state\r\n- **Recoil** is an experimental library using a data-flow graph\r\n\r\nHaving complex state doesn't necessarily mean you _have_ to pull for a third-party library. You can start with React and JavaScript and see how far it takes you. If optimizing requires a state management library, you can track that metric (e.g. frame rate), measure it, and verify it solves a real problem.\r\n\r\n**Don't choose one of these libraries unless there's an obvious need.**\r\n\r\n### Immutable State\r\n\r\nAnother debate is mutable vs. immutable state. There's no right answers, just opinions. If you were doing state management with vanilla JavaScript, you'll likely have mutable state. You initialize a variable, and then later set it equal to some new value. There are [entire debates](https://overreacted.io/on-let-vs-const/) on `let` vs. `const`.\r\n\r\nImmutable state gained a lot of popularity with React. The immutable crowd argues that allowing your state management solution of choice to mutate state directly results in more bugs. The mutable crowd argues it's not worth the complexity trade-off. Direct manipulation will always be less safe than indirect manipulation. It's a tradeoff between convenience and risk, which is up to you and your team.\r\n\r\nSolutions like [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) allow you to write mutable code but _execute_ it immutably. Fancy. The basic idea is you apply your changes to a _draft state_, which is a proxy of the _current state_. Once the mutations have completed Immer will produce the _next state_ based on the changes to the draft state.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Immer Immutable State`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/react-state-management/immer.png`}\r\n  width={1000}\r\n  height={389}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### URL State\r\n\r\nLet's say you're building an e-commerce website like Amazon. You search for React books and filter by 4+ stars. This state is persisted as query parameters and managed by the browser. When you refresh the page, you see the same list of products. You can share this URL with others and they also see the same results.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Amazon URL State`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/react-state-management/amazon.png`}\r\n  width={1000}\r\n  height={732}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nAnother interesting example of this is Nomad List. We can transform the browser URL state into a function of our data. Plus, we can make human-readable URLs (which Google prefers).\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Nomad List URL State`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/react-state-management/nomad.png`}\r\n  width={1000}\r\n  height={676}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Future\r\n\r\nFor large applications, it's possible a naive Context-based state management solutions (e.g. with `useReducer`) could have issues with excessive re-rendering. When a context value changes, all components that `useContext` will re-render. This makes UI interactions feel slow and janky. If you can't visually notice it, you can [use React Dev Tools](https://brycedooley.com/debug-react-rerenders/) to investigate re-rendering.\r\n\r\nThe React team has proposed a `useSelectedContext` hook to prevent performance issues with Context at scale. This [RFC was introduced](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/119) in July 2019 and [progress has started](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20646) as of January 2021 behind a feature flag. This hook allows you to select a \"slice\" of Context and only re-render when that piece changes.\r\n\r\nThere are ways to work around re-rendering performance already (e.g. `useMemo`) but a first-party solution for Context is preferred. There's also a community library [useContextSelector](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector), which takes a similar approach ([demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/usecontextselector-demo-sixdr?file=/src/App.js)). [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) and [Formik 3](https://formik.org/blog/formik-3-alpha) use this under the hood. Having `useSelectedContext` as part of the React standard library will eliminate complexity and code size in external libraries, as well as provide more performant options by default.\r\n\r\nIn the longer-term future, React will automatically figure out which components to re-render (\"[auto-memoization](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/119#issuecomment-586390430)\").\r\n\r\n## State Management Options\r\n\r\nThis is not a comprehensive list. It's also open-source, so please open a PR if you disagree or if something is wrong. In general, lean on whatever empowers your developers and team. **Happy with Redux? Stay there!**\r\n\r\n### Form State\r\n\r\n| Experience   | Learning Appetite | Project/Team Size | Solution                          |\r\n| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |\r\n| Beginner     | Low               | Small             | useState                          |\r\n| Beginner     | Medium            | Medium, Small     | Form Library (Formik, Final Form) |\r\n| Beginner     | High, Medium      | Large             | Ask your tech lead                |\r\n| Intermediate | Low               | Medium, Small     | Form Library (Formik, Final Form) |\r\n| Advanced     | Medium            | Medium            | State Machines                    |\r\n| Advanced     | High              | Medium            | State Machines                    |\r\n| Advanced     | High              | Large             | State Machines                    |\r\n\r\n### UI State\r\n\r\n| Experience   | Learning Appetite | Project/Team Size | Solution                             |\r\n| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |\r\n| Beginner     | Low               | Small             | useState                             |\r\n| Beginner     | Medium            | Medium, Small     | useContext + useReducer              |\r\n| Beginner     | High, Medium      | Large             | Ask your tech lead                   |\r\n| Intermediate | Low               | Medium, Small     | Redux Toolkit                        |\r\n| Advanced     | Medium            | Medium            | useContext + useReducer              |\r\n| Advanced     | High              | Medium            | Jotai, Valtio                        |\r\n| Advanced     | High              | Large             | Recoil (or Relay if you use GraphQL) |\r\n\r\n### Server Cache State\r\n\r\nRegardless of experience or team size, both [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) and [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) are excellent solutions. You'll be happy with either. If you're using GraphQL, you probably already know about [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/).\r\n\r\n### That's all, folks!\r\n\r\nState management in React has evolved massively over the past eight years. It's one of the most difficult, nuanced parts of building large web applications. Understanding the different types of state and their trade-offs is crucial for making an informed decision.

Articles with lots of views indicate the content your readers care most about.\r\nThis helps drive future articles.\r\n\r\nMost people measure view counts via analytics (like [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)).\r\nHowever, with the rise of ad-blocking browser extensions, these counts are likely [~10% off](https://moz.com/blog/analytics-black-holes) (especially if your target market is tech).\r\nWhat if we could have better accuracy, better performance, and better privacy for our users?\r\n\r\nThis post will show how to display real-time view counts for a given blog post using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database).\r\nWe can host and deploy this entire solution **for free** using Firebase's [free tier](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com).\r\n\r\n## Setting Up Firebase\r\n\r\n1.  If you do not have a Firebase account, create one first.\r\n2.  Create a new project.\r\n3.  Navigate to \"Database\" and click \"Create Database\".\r\n    <Image\r\n      alt={`Create Firebase Database`}\r\n      src={`/static/images/real-time-post-views/firebase/step1.png`}\r\n      width={1000}\r\n      height={534}\r\n    />\r\n4.  Start in test mode and click next.\r\n    <Image\r\n      alt={`Create Firebase Database`}\r\n      src={`/static/images/real-time-post-views/firebase/step2.png`}\r\n      width={1000}\r\n      height={533}\r\n    />\r\n5.  Choose your database location and click done.\r\n    <Image\r\n      alt={`Create Firebase Database`}\r\n      src={`/static/images/real-time-post-views/firebase/step3.png`}\r\n      width={1000}\r\n      height={532}\r\n    />\r\n6.  In the top left, click on \"Project Settings\".\r\n    <Image\r\n      alt={`Create Firebase Database`}\r\n      src={`/static/images/real-time-post-views/firebase/step4.png`}\r\n      width={979}\r\n      height={386}\r\n    />\r\n7.  Navigate to \"Service Accounts\" tab and click \"Generate new private key\". Save the `.json` file. You will need this later.\r\n    <Image\r\n      alt={`Create Firebase Database`}\r\n      src={`/static/images/real-time-post-views/firebase/step5.png`}\r\n      width={1000}\r\n      height={535}\r\n    />\r\n\r\nWe're finished! 🎉 You have successfully set up a realtime database, as well as generated credentials to connect to the database.\r\n\r\n## Connecting To Firebase\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to install the `firebase-admin` server-side SDK.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ yarn add firebase-admin\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, we need to create an `.env.local` file to add the values for the Firebase service account `.json` file.\r\nSpecifically, `private_key`, `project_id`, and `client_email`.\r\n\r\n```bash:.env\r\nNEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=replace-me\r\nFIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=replace-me\r\nFIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=\"replace-me\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure you include the quotes around \"replace-me\" for `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`.\r\n\r\nYou will need to restart your application to load new environment variables.\r\nCreate a new file `lib/firebase.js` to initialize the application and establish a connection.\r\n\r\n```js:lib/firebase.js\r\nimport * as admin from 'firebase-admin';\r\n\r\nif (!admin.apps.length) {\r\n  admin.initializeApp({\r\n    credential: admin.credential.cert({\r\n      projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,\r\n      clientEmail: process.env.FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL,\r\n      privateKey: process.env.FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY.replace(/\\\\n/g, '\\n')\r\n    })\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst db = admin.firestore();\r\n\r\nexport { db };\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tracking Views\r\n\r\nTo track a view, we need to look at the database for `views -> id`. Let's create a new [API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\r\nto communicate with our database and increment the views for a given `id`.\r\n\r\n[API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) provide a straight-forward solution for building an API inside Next.js.\r\nAll you need to get started is an `api/` folder inside your main `pages/` folder where your routes live. Every file inside `pages/api/` is mapped to `/api/*`.\r\n\r\n```js:pages/api/views/[slug].js\r\nimport { db } from '../../lib/firebase';\r\n\r\nexport default async (req, res) => {\r\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\r\n    const ref = db.ref('views').child(req.query.slug);\r\n    const { snapshot } = await ref.transaction((currentViews) => {\r\n      if (currentViews === null) {\r\n        return 1;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return currentViews + 1;\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return res.status(200).json({\r\n      total: snapshot.val()\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor an API route to work, you need to export a default function (i.e., **request handler**), which receives the following parameters:\r\n\r\n- `req`: An instance of [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), plus some [pre-built middlewares](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/api-middlewares).\r\n- `res`: An instance of [http.ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), plus some [helper functions](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/response-helpers).\r\n\r\n## Testing View Counts\r\n\r\nUsing your favorite REST client or your browser, you can now hit `http://localhost:3000/api/views/my-blog` to log a view.\r\nWe can confirm it was logged correctly by checking Firebase.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Testing Firebase`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/real-time-post-views/testing-database.png`}\r\n  width={1000}\r\n  height={562}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Fetching Data from Firebase\r\n\r\n[SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) is a React Hooks library for remote data fetching.\r\nSWR first returns the data from cache (stale), then sends the fetch request (revalidate), and finally comes with the up-to-date data again.\r\n\r\nThis will allow us to fetch view counts from Firebase.\r\nIf you re-focus or switch between tabs, SWR will [automatically revalidate data](https://swr.now.sh/#focus-revalidation).\r\n\r\nLet's install SWR now.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ yarn add swr\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, we need to update our API Route to fetch the views for a given post.\r\n\r\n```js:pages/api/views/[slug].js\r\nimport { db } from '../../lib/firebase';\r\n\r\nexport default async (req, res) => {\r\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\r\n    const ref = db.ref('views').child(req.query.slug);\r\n    const { snapshot } = await ref.transaction((currentViews) => {\r\n      if (currentViews === null) {\r\n        return 1;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return currentViews + 1;\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return res.status(200).json({\r\n      total: snapshot.val()\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  if (req.method === 'GET') {\r\n    const snapshot = await db.ref('views').child(req.query.slug).once('value');\r\n    const views = snapshot.val();\r\n\r\n    return res.status(200).json({ total: views });\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## View Counter\r\n\r\nLet's create a `ViewCounter` component to use SWR.\r\n\r\n```jsx:components/ViewCounter.js\r\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\r\nimport useSWR from 'swr';\r\n\r\nasync function fetcher(...args) {\r\n  const res = await fetch(...args);\r\n\r\n  return res.json();\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default function ViewCounter({ slug }) {\r\n  const { data } = useSWR(`/api/views/${slug}`, fetcher);\r\n  const views = new Number(data?.total);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const registerView = () =>\r\n      fetch(`/api/views/${slug}`, {\r\n        method: 'POST'\r\n      });\r\n\r\n    registerView();\r\n  }, [slug]);\r\n\r\n  return `${views > 0 ? views.toLocaleString() : '–––'} views`;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we can consume the view counter in our blog post and pass in the ID.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<ViewCounter slug=\"my-post\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deployment with Vercel\r\n\r\nWhen adding your Firebase private key inside the Vercel dashboard, ensure that you\r\nconvert new line characters (`\\n`) to actual new lines. For example, here's a fake private key.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----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\r\nIlpxVgdxp5tb9JOG3aoMMg==\r\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the extra new line at the end.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nYou can view a completed example by checking out [this blog post's source code](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io).\r\nI was able to migrate my page views from Google Analytics into Firebase via their web interface.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Blog Post Views`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/real-time-post-views/blog-post-views.png`}\r\n  width={1000}\r\n  height={599}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n**Note**: If your site receives a lot of traffic, you'll need to upgrade from the Spark plan (free) to Blaze (pay-as-you-go).\r\nOn Spark, you can only have 100 simultaneous connections.

      "raw": "\r\nOver the years, I've had many resume iterations. As I moved into my [new role](/blog/2019) last month, I went to update my resume — That's when I realized it was terrible.\r\n\r\nThis is going to be a sort of _resume retrospective_. Basically, I'm just going to roast myself. Laugh at my mistakes and learn from my failures.\r\n\r\n## 2016 Resume\r\n\r\nThis was my resume out of college which helped me land my first full-time engineering job. There were more resume iterations before this, obviously, but they were terrible.\r\nLet me save _some_ dignity.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`2016 Resume`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/resume/2016.jpg`}\r\n  width={956}\r\n  height={1241}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nOkay, I'll start with the **good**.\r\n\r\n- It's one page. The layout is clean and comfortable to read. Good job, Lee.\r\n- The job title is more prominent than the employer.\r\n- Most bullet points are useful (not too much content).\r\n- Projects and GPA are still relevant because I'm fresh out of college.\r\n\r\nWhat about the **bad**?\r\n\r\n- This thing is written with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). Why? Because that's what everyone on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions) did. Talk about over-engineering.\r\n- My middle name is not relevant. My name isn't that generic.\r\n- My phone number is not needed. This trend persisted for a while.\r\n- Some of the bullet points talk about _what_ I did instead of the _impact_ I made.\r\n- \"Videographer\" is not relevant to the position I'm interviewing for.\r\n\r\n## 2017 Resume\r\n\r\nIn 2017, I got the bright idea to re-design my resume. The content didn't change much.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`2017 Resume`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/resume/2017.jpg`}\r\n  width={961}\r\n  height={1244}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThere's some **good**:\r\n\r\n- At a glance, you can quickly parse the content.\r\n- Easy to read font.\r\n- Education moved down now that I have a full-time job.\r\n\r\nThere are some **issues**, though:\r\n\r\n- This custom Photoshop design did _not_ work well with Applicant Tracking Systems, or [ATS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system) for short. Which is, ya know, the whole point 🤦🏻‍♂️\r\n- The location of the companies is not relevant.\r\n\r\n## 2018 Resume\r\n\r\nIn 2018, [I switched jobs](/blog/joining-hy-vee). Time to dust off the ol' resume. But, just when you thought it couldn't get worse...\r\n\r\n**I made this thing with InDesign**.\r\n\r\nIt had an embedded font. Well, it turns out the embedded font didn't work in Firefox. So the resume was basically unreadable in some cases.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`2018 Resume`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/resume/2018.jpg`}\r\n  width={961}\r\n  height={1245}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nI don't have much good to say here, so let's just go straight to the **bad**:\r\n\r\n- The about section is a complete waste of space. Save it for [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leejamesrobinson/).\r\n- References are not needed on the resume.\r\n- I'm not sure why I decided to drop the start and end dates from my work positions. \"3 years\" isn't very descriptive.\r\n- The GitHub link is unnecessary. You can find it on my website.\r\n\r\n## 2019 Resume\r\n\r\nBrace yourself. We've now reached peak monstrosity.\r\n\r\nI finally gave up on custom designs and opted to use a service called [Standard Resume](https://standardresume.co/). It was easy, required little maintenance, and worked much better with ATS.\r\n\r\nPlus, I thought, let's add every single thing I've ever accomplished. I committed the ultimate sin. **I made a two-page resume.**\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`2019 Resume`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/resume/2019.jpg`}\r\n  width={887}\r\n  height={2187}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nSome things are **good**:\r\n\r\n- The skills section made a comeback. ATS love those buzzwords.\r\n- Some of the newer bullet points have excellent metrics.\r\n- It's a wonderful design. Easy to read.\r\n\r\nBut others are **bad**. Really bad:\r\n\r\n- I've been out of college long enough that I can drop the internships.\r\n- Instead of putting freelance dev work, I put a project ([dsmtech](https://dsmtech.io)).\r\n- GPA is not relevant anymore. Then again... was it ever relevant?\r\n- Did I mention it's 2 pages? No one has time for that.\r\n\r\n## 2020 Resume\r\n\r\nThat brings us [to now](/robinson-resume-2019.pdf). Behold, this single sheet of (digital) paper.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`2020 Resume`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/resume/2020.jpg`}\r\n  width={960}\r\n  height={1243}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nI made this with Pages on Mac. No custom fonts. No crazy design.\r\nI'd like to think it's the culmination of all the points made above.\r\n\r\n- It's easy to update and maintain.\r\n- The font is readable, and there's a good use of bold and italic.\r\n- Unnecessary information is omitted (GPA, projects, internships, phone number).\r\n- More relevant information is included (skills, freelance work).\r\n- Industry normalized job title (Software Engineer III -> Senior Software Engineer).\r\n- There are clear start/end dates with the same format throughout.\r\n- Proper use of whitespace.\r\n\r\nYou don't need a two-page resume.\r\n",

It's a modern replacement for languages like C++ or C with a focus on code safety and concise syntax.\r\n\r\nRust is quite different than JavaScript. JavaScript tries to find variables or objects not in use and automatically clears them from memory. This is called [Garbage Collection](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)>). The language abstracts the developer from thinking about manual memory management.\r\n\r\nWith Rust, developers have more control over memory allocation, without it being as painful as C++.\r\n\r\n> Rust uses a relatively unique memory management approach that incorporates the idea of memory “ownership”. Basically, Rust keeps track of who can read and write to memory. It knows when the program is using memory and immediately frees the memory once it is no longer needed. It enforces memory rules at compile time, making it virtually impossible to have runtime memory bugs. You do not need to manually keep track of memory. The compiler takes care of it. – [Discord](https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f)\r\n\r\n## Adoption\r\n\r\nOn top of the companies mentioned above, Rust is also being used for popular open-source libraries like:\r\n\r\n- [Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker) (AWS)\r\n- [Bottlerocket](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket) (AWS)\r\n- [Quiche](https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche) (Cloudflare)\r\n- [Neqo](https://github.com/mozilla/neqo) (Mozilla)\r\n\r\n> Rust has been a force multiplier for our team, and betting on Rust was one of the best decisions we made. More than performance, its ergonomics and focus on correctness has helped us tame sync’s complexity. We can encode complex invariants about our system in the type system and have the compiler check them for us. – [Dropbox](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine)\r\n\r\n## From JavaScript to Rust\r\n\r\nJavaScript is the most widely used programming language, operating on every device with a web browser. Over the past ten years, a massive ecosystem has been built around JavaScript:\r\n\r\n- **Webpack:** developers wanted to bundle multiple JavaScript files into one.\r\n- **Babel:** developers wanted to write modern JavaScript while supporting older browsers.\r\n- **Terser:** developers wanted to generate the smallest possible file sizes.\r\n- **Prettier:** developers wanted an opinionated code formatter that just worked.\r\n- **ESLint:** developers wanted to find issues with their code before deploying.\r\n\r\nMillions of lines of code have been written and even more bugs have been fixed to create the bedrock for shipping web applications of today. All of these tools are written with JavaScript or TypeScript. This has worked well, but we've reached peak optimization with JS. This has inspired a new class of tools, designed to drastically improve the performance of building for the web.\r\n\r\n### SWC\r\n\r\n[SWC](http://swc.rs/), created in 2017, is an extensible Rust-based platform for the next generation of fast developer tools. It's used by tools like Next.js, Parcel, and Deno, as well as companies like Vercel, ByteDance, Tencent, Shopify, and more.\r\n\r\nSWC can be used for compilation, minification, bundling, and more – and is designed to be extended. It's something you can call to perform code transformations (either built-in or custom). Running those transformations happens through higher-level tools like Next.js.\r\n\r\n### Deno\r\n\r\n[Deno](https://deno.land/), created in 2018, is a simple, modern, and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses [V8](https://v8.dev/) and is built with Rust. It's an attempt to replace Node.js, written by the original creators of Node.js. While it was created in 2018, it didn't hit [v1.0 until May 2020](https://deno.com/blog/v1).\r\n\r\nDeno’s linter, code formatter, and docs generator are [built using SWC](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1369033422002389000).\r\n\r\n### esbuild\r\n\r\n[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), created in January 2020, is a JavaScript bundler and minifier 10-100x faster than existing tools, written in Go.\r\n\r\n> I'm trying to create a build tool that A) works well for a given sweet spot of use cases (bundling JavaScript, TypeScript, and maybe CSS) and B) **resets the expectations of the community for what it means for a JavaScript build tool to be fast**. Our current tools are way too slow in my opinion. – Evan, Creator of esbuild ([Source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22336334))\r\n\r\nBuilding JavaScript tooling with systems programming languages, like Go and Rust, was fairly niche until esbuild was released. In my opinion, esbuild sparked a wider interest in trying to make developer tools faster. Evan chose to use Go:\r\n\r\n> The Rust version probably could be made to work at an equivalent speed with enough effort. But at a high level, Go was much more enjoyable to work with. This is a side project and it has to be fun for me to work on it. – Evan, Creator of esbuild ([Source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22336284))\r\n\r\nSome argue Rust could perform better, but both could achieve Evan's original goal of influencing the community:\r\n\r\n> Even with just basic optimization, Rust was able to outperform the hyper hand-tuned Go version. This is a huge testament to how easy it is to write efficient programs with Rust compared to the deep dive we had to do with Go. – [Discord](https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f)\r\n\r\n### Rome\r\n\r\n[Rome](https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome), created in August 2020, is a linter, compiler, bundler, test runner, and more, for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and CSS. They aim to replace and unify the entire frontend development toolchain. It's created by [Sebastian](https://twitter.com/sebmck), who also created Babel.\r\n\r\nWhy rewrite everything, then?\r\n\r\n> Making the necessary modifications to Babel to allow for it to be a reliable base for other tools would have required changes to absolutely everything. The architecture is bound to the initial design choices I made in 2014 when I was learning about parsers, ASTs, and compilers. - Sebastian ([Source](https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome))\r\n\r\nRome is currently written in TypeScript and runs on Node.js. But they're now working on [rewriting in Rust](https://rome.tools/blog/2021/09/21/rome-will-be-rewritten-in-rust) using RSLint parser and their own visitor system for AST traversal.\r\n\r\n### NAPI\r\n\r\nRust’s integration with Node.js is better than other low-level languages.\r\n\r\n[napi-rs](https://napi.rs/) allows you to build pre-compiled Node.js add-ons with Rust. It provides an out-of-the-box solution for cross-compilation and publishing native binaries to NPM, without needing `node-gyp` or `postinstall` scripts.\r\n\r\nYou can build a Rust module that can be called directly from Node.js, without needing to create a child process like esbuild.\r\n\r\n## Rust + WebAssembly\r\n\r\n[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/) *(*WASM*)* is a portable low-level language that Rust can compile to. It runs in the browser, is interoperable with JavaScript, and is supported in all major modern browsers.\r\n\r\n> WASM is definitely a lot faster than JS, but not quite native speed. In our tests, Parcel runs 10-20x slower when compiled to WASM than with native binaries. – [Devon Govett](https://twitter.com/devongovett)\r\n\r\nWhile WASM isn't the perfect solution yet, it _can_ help developers create extremely fast web experiences. The Rust team is [committed](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm) to a high-quality and cutting-edge WASM implementation. For developers, this means you could have the performance advantages of Rust (vs. Go) while still compiling for the web (using WASM).\r\n\r\nSome early libraries and frameworks in this space:\r\n\r\n- [Yew](https://yew.rs/)\r\n- [Percy](https://github.com/chinedufn/percy)\r\n- [Seed](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed)\r\n- [Sycamore](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore)\r\n- [Stork](https://stork-search.net/)\r\n\r\nThese Rust-based web frameworks that compile to WASM aren't trying to replace JavaScript, but work alongside it. While we aren't there yet, it's interesting to see Rust coming after the web on both sides: **making existing JavaScript tooling faster** _and_ **future-forward ideas for [compiling to WASM](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html)**.\r\n\r\nIt's Rust all the way down.\r\n\r\n## Why Not Rust?\r\n\r\nRust has a steep learning curve. It's a lower level of abstraction than what most web developers are used to.\r\n\r\nOnce you're on native code (through Rust, Go, Zig, or other low-level languages),\r\nthe algorithms and data structures are [more important](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1457945506332692482) than the language choice. It's not a silver bullet.\r\n\r\n> Rust makes you think about dimensions of your code that matter tremendously for systems programming. It makes you think about how memory is shared or copied. It makes you think about real but unlikely corner cases and make sure that they’re handled. It helps you write code that’s incredibly efficient in every possible way. – Tom MacWright ([Source](https://macwright.com/2021/01/15/rust.html))\r\n\r\nFurther, Rust's usage in the web community is still niche. It hasn't reached critical adoption. Even though learning Rust for JavaScript tooling will be a barrier to entry, interestingly developers would rather have a [faster tool that's harder to contribute to](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1261379312898306048). [Fast software wins](https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/).\r\n\r\nCurrently, it's hard to find a Rust library or framework for your favorite services (things like working with authentication, databases, payments, and more). I do think that once Rust and WASM reach critical adoption, this will resolve itself. But not yet. **We need existing JavaScript tools to help us bridge the gap and incrementally adopt performance improvements**.\r\n\r\n## The Future of JavaScript Tooling\r\n\r\nI believe Rust is the future of JavaScript tooling. [Next.js 12](http://nextjs.org/12) started our transition to fully replace Babel (transpilation) and Terser (minification) with SWC and Rust. Why?\r\n\r\n- **Extensibility:** SWC can be used as a Crate inside Next.js, without having to fork the library or workaround design constraints.\r\n- **Performance:** We were able to achieve ~3x faster Fast Refresh and ~5x faster builds in Next.js by switching to SWC, with more room for optimization still in progress.\r\n- **WebAssembly:** Rust's support for WASM is essential for supporting all possible platforms and taking Next.js development everywhere.\r\n- **Community:** The Rust community and ecosystem are amazing and only growing.\r\n\r\nIt's not just Next.js adopting SWC, either:\r\n\r\n- [Deno’s](https://deno.land/) linter, code formatter, and docs generator are [built using SWC](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1369033422002389000).\r\n- [dprint](https://github.com/devongovett/dprint-node), built on SWC, is a [30x faster](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1400138335721455617) code formatting replacement for Prettier.\r\n- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) improved overall build performance by [up to 10x](https://v2.parceljs.org/blog/beta3/) with SWC.\r\n\r\n> Parcel uses SWC like a library. Before we used Babel's parser and custom transforms written in JS. Now, we use SWC's parser and [custom transforms in Rust](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/tree/v2/packages/transformers/js/core/src). This includes a full scope hoisting implementation, dependency collection, and more. It's similar in scope to how Deno built on top of SWC. – [Devon Govett](https://twitter.com/devongovett)\r\n\r\nIt's early days for Rust – a few important pieces are still being figured out:\r\n\r\n- **Plugins:** Writing plugins in Rust isn't as approachable for many JavaScript developers. At the same time, exposing a plugin system in JavaScript could negate performance gains. A definitive solution hasn't emerged yet. Ideally, the future combines both JavaScript and Rust. If you want to write a plugin with JavaScript, it’s possible with a tradeoff for speed. Need more performance? Use the Rust plugin API.\r\n- **Bundling:** One interesting area of development is `swcpack`, which is SWC's replacement for Webpack. It's still under development but could be very promising.\r\n- **WebAssembly:** As mentioned above, the prospect of writing Rust and compiling to WASM is enticing, but there's still work to be done.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I'm confident Rust will continue to have a major impact on the JavaScript ecosystem for the next 1-2 years and into the future. Imagine a world where all of the build tools used in Next.js are written in Rust, giving you optimal performance. Then, Next.js could be distributed as a [static binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_build) you'd download from NPM.\r\n\r\nThat's the world I want to live (and develop) in.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_Thanks to [Devon Govett](https://twitter.com/devongovett) for reviewing an early draft of this article._\r\n",

The compiler takes care of it. \\u2013 \",(0,t.jsx)(e.a,{href:\"https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f\",children:\"Discord\"})]}),`\n`]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.h2,{id:\"adoption\",children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.a,{className:\"anchor\",href:\"#adoption\",children:(0,t.jsx)(e.span,{className:\"icon icon-link\"})}),\"Adoption\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"On top of the companies mentioned above, Rust is also being used for popular open-source libraries like:\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.ul,{children:[`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.li,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.a,{href:\"https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker\",children:\"Firecracker\"}),\" (AWS)\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.li,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.a,{href:\"https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket\",children:\"Bottlerocket\"}),\" (AWS)\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.li,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.a,{href:\"https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche\",children:\"Quiche\"}),\" (Cloudflare)\"]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.li,{children:[(0,t.jsx)(e.a,{href:\"https://github.com/mozilla/neqo\",children:\"Neqo\"}),\" (Mozilla)\"]}),`\n`]}),`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.blockquote,{children:[`\n`,(0,t.jsxs)(e.p,{children:[\"Rust has been a force multiplier for our team, and betting on Rust was one of the best decisions we made.

    "image": "/static/images/serverless-redis-nextjs/og.png",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\r\nWhen front-end developers are learning the full-stack, they often stumble on which [backend to use](/blog/backend). If they hear Redis, they think of in-memory caching. That's what I thought, at least.\r\nAfter doing more research, I was surprised to find Redis excels at [hashmaps, counters, sorted lists, and even queues](http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/take-advantage-of-redis-adding-it-to-your-stack.html). It's possible to use Redis for your entire database!\r\n\r\nThis article will explore using Redis with Next.js in Serverless environments.\r\n\r\n### Creating a Redis Instance\r\n\r\n[Upstash](https://upstash.com/) is the easiest way I've found to deploy a managed Redis instance. A few reasons I recommend it:\r\n\r\n- There's a generous free tier, and then per-request pricing when you're ready to upgrade. This keeps costs free (or extremely low). There's even a $120/month cap to prevent surprises, plus reserved plans for larger projects.\r\n- With Upstash, you can use Redis for more than just caching with durable storage. There's even [Strong Consistency](https://docs.upstash.com/docs/overall/consistency) mode for guaranteed, durable writes.\r\n- It's fast. Really, really fast. Extremely low latency.\r\n\r\nThe Upstash Integration for Vercel makes it easy to get started with Serverless Redis. We'll start by deploying the [completed project](https://roadmap-redis.vercel.app/), and then running the application locally.\r\n\r\n1. [Deploy the demo to Vercel using the Upstash Integration.](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-redis&project-name=redis-roadmap&repository-name=redis-roadmap&demo-title=Redis%20Roadmap&demo-description=Create%20and%20upvote%20features%20for%20your%20product.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Froadmap-redis.vercel.app%2F&integration-ids=oac_V3R1GIpkoJorr6fqyiwdhl17)\r\n2. You'll be prompted to sign-up or sign-in to Upstash.\r\n3. Then, you can create a free database and attach it to your Vercel project.\r\n4. Click \"Complete on Vercel\".\r\n5. That's it! You should have a deployed project and URL.\r\n\r\nBy default, both Vercel and Upstash use the `us-east-1` region for Serverless Functions. Using the same region is critical to minimize latency between your [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/serverless-functions/introduction) and Redis.\r\n\r\n### Connecting to Redis\r\n\r\nIf you're using Vercel, you can clone the git repository created during deployment.\r\nThe `REDIS_URL` environment variable was added by the Upstash Integration while deploying. To run the application locally, we'll need to pull our environment variables locally using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download).\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n$ vercel link\r\n$ vercel env pull .env.local\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Vercel, you can clone this demo locally using `npx create-next-app --example with-redis roadmap`.\r\nThen, create an `.env.local` file in the root of your repository and add the Redis connection string.\r\n\r\n```jsx:.env.local\r\nREDIS_URL=redis://:password@endpoint:port\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll use [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis), a Node.js Redis client with [async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) support, to connect to Redis.\r\n\r\n```jsx:lib/redis.js\r\nimport Redis from 'ioredis';\r\n\r\nconst redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);\r\n\r\nexport default redis;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we can use this inside any page or API Route to retrieve information from Redis.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport redis from 'lib/redis';\r\n\r\nconst value = JSON.parse(await redis.hget('feedback', id));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Using Redis with Next.js\r\n\r\nHere's a few common Redis commands you might need to use:\r\n\r\n- Fetching a JSON object: `redis.hget('feedback', id)`\r\n- Creating a JSON object: `redis.hset('feedback', id, \"{'key': 'val'}\")`\r\n- Deleting by key: `redis.hdel('feedback', id)`\r\n- Fetching a list of items: `redis.hvals('feedback')`\r\n\r\nIn the demo application, we use Redis for the following:\r\n\r\n1. The feature list is server-rendered using `getServerSideProps`. We fetch all features and sort based on the score and title.\r\n1. The initial feature list from the server populates the local cache of [SWR](swr.vercel.app). This ensures data remains up-to-date on the client-side.\r\n1. When adding features or emails, a `POST` request is sent to an [API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) to update Redis.\r\n1. Adding/upvoting features will mutate the client-side cache for [optimistic UI updates](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/mutation).\r\n\r\nYou can view the entire Redis API [here](https://redis.io/commands). For more advanced Redis usage, see the Redis API compatibility with Upstash [here](https://docs.upstash.com/docs/overall/rediscompatibility/).\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nI frequently need to store data, somewhere. It doesn't always need to be complex – a key/value store will often suffice.\r\nAfter working more with Upstash, Redis is now my preferred solution for this (and apparently [many other people's as well](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2020-programming-language-framework-salary-data/)).\r\n\r\n- [View the demo ✨](https://roadmap-redis.vercel.app/)\r\n- [Deploy your own 🚀](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-redis&project-name=redis-roadmap&repository-name=redis-roadmap&demo-title=Redis%20Roadmap&demo-description=Create%20and%20upvote%20features%20for%20your%20product.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Froadmap-redis.vercel.app%2F&integration-ids=oac_V3R1GIpkoJorr6fqyiwdhl17)\r\n\r\n**Bonus:** If you need to inspect your Redis database locally, check out [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) for a GUI and [redis-cli](https://docs.upstash.com/docs/overall/getstarted#connect-to-your-database) if you prefer the command-line.\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Space Invaders`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/space-invaders-with-python/banner.png`}\r\n  width={793}\r\n  height={618}\r\n  priority\r\n/>\r\n\r\nTo challenge my knowledge of [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming, I created a clone of the classic arcade game [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) and added a modern twist. My goal for this project was to replicate the core gameplay of the original while enhancing the graphics and gameplay ever so slightly. I used a set of Python modules designed for writing games called [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news.html) to assist in the development. Prior to this project I had no experience using Pygame, so it was an exciting learning experience. You can view the full source code on my GitHub profile [here](https://github.com/leerob/Space_Invaders).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Design\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Space Invaders`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/space-invaders-with-python/space-invaders.png`}\r\n  width={795}\r\n  height={620}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nIf you've ever played Space Invaders, you'll notice all the familiar elements - the ship, invaders, blockers, score, and lives. The classic game features five rows of eleven enemies. For my clone, I decided to only use ten per row so the screen didn't feel too congested. To spice up the visuals from the original arcade game, I gave the enemies different colors to signify their point values. Also, rather than using a static black background, I chose to use an image of space for some extra flair. The final change from the original is the ship. Paying homage to the design from [Galaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga), I transformed the ship into a stylish cruiser.\r\n\r\n### Gameplay\r\n\r\nSpace Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a ship with lasers by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of ten aliens that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the bottom of the screen. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up.\r\n\r\nThe aliens attempt to destroy the ship by firing at it while they approach the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom, the alien invasion is successful and the game ends. A special \"mystery ship\" will occasionally move across the top of the screen and award bonus points if destroyed. The ship is partially protected by several stationary defense bunkers that are gradually destroyed by projectiles from the aliens and player.\r\n\r\nI tried to keep the gameplay as similar to the original as I could.

      "raw": "\r\nOne of my favorite parts of my website is my [dashboard](/dashboard).\r\nIt's a fun, unique way for me to showcase various metrics about my life.\r\nIt's also a playground for experimenting with new technology and APIs.\r\nIt currently has integrations with YouTube, Unsplash, Firebase, [Revue](/snippets/revue), GitHub, Gumroad, and now Spotify!\r\n\r\nI wanted to display what song I'm currently listening to, as well as my top tracks.\r\nTo accomplish this, I'd need to integrate [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) with Next.js [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).\r\nThis post will be a quick tutorial to get up and running with Spotify.\r\n\r\n## Create an Application\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to create a Spotify application to give us credentials to authenticate with the API.\r\n\r\n- Go to your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and log in.\r\n- Click **Create an App**.\r\n- Fill out the name and description and click **create**.\r\n- Click **Show Client Secret**.\r\n- Save your Client ID and Secret. You'll need these soon.\r\n- Click **Edit Settings**.\r\n- Add `http://localhost:3000` as a redirect URI.\r\n\r\nAll done! You now have a properly configured Spotify application and the correct credentials to make requests.\r\n\r\n## Authentication\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of ways to authenticate with the Spotify API, depending on your application. Since we only need permission granted _once_, we'll use the [Authorization Code Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow).\r\n\r\nFirst, we'll have our application request authorization by logging in with whatever [scopes](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#list-of-scopes) we need.\r\nHere's an example of what the URL might look like.\r\nSwap out the `client_id` and scopes for your own.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nhttps://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=8e94bde7dd\r\nb84a1f7a0e51bf3bc95be8&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http\r\n%3A%2F%2Flocalhost:3000&scope=user-read-currently-playing%20\r\nuser-top-read\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter authorizing, you'll be redirected back to your `redirect_uri`.\r\nIn the URL, there's a `code` query parameter. Save this value.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nhttp://localhost:3000/callback?code=NApCCg..BkWtQ\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, we'll need to retrieve the refresh token. You'll need to generate a Base 64 encoded string containing the client ID and secret from earlier. You can use [this tool](https://www.base64encode.org/) to encode it online. The format should be `client_id:client_secret`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Basic <base64 encoded client_id:client_secret>\"\r\n-d grant_type=authorization_code -d code=<code> -d redirect_uri=http%3A\r\n%2F%2Flocalhost:3000 https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will return a JSON response containing a `refresh_token`. This token is [valid indefinitely](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/374) unless you revoke access, so we'll want to save this in an environment variable.\r\n\r\n## Using Spotify's API\r\n\r\nFinally, we can get some real data! Inside Next.js, create three new values in your `.env.local` file.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nSPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=\r\nSPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=\r\nSPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** If you haven't worked with environment variables in Next before, [give this a read first](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).\r\n\r\nWe can now request an access token using our client ID, client secret, and `refresh_token`.\r\n\r\n```js:lib/spotify.js\r\nimport querystring from 'querystring';\r\n\r\nconst client_id = process.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID;\r\nconst client_secret = process.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET;\r\nconst refresh_token = process.env.SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN;\r\n\r\nconst basic = Buffer.from(`${client_id}:${client_secret}`).toString('base64');\r\nconst TOKEN_ENDPOINT = `https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token`;\r\n\r\nconst getAccessToken = async () => {\r\n  const response = await fetch(TOKEN_ENDPOINT, {\r\n    method: 'POST',\r\n    headers: {\r\n      Authorization: `Basic ${basic}`,\r\n      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'\r\n    },\r\n    body: querystring.stringify({\r\n      grant_type: 'refresh_token',\r\n      refresh_token\r\n    })\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return response.json();\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse this `access_token` to securely request your top tracks.\r\nThis assumes you added the `user-top-read` scope at the beginning.\r\n\r\n```js:lib/spotify.js\r\nconst TOP_TRACKS_ENDPOINT = `https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/tracks`;\r\n\r\nexport const getTopTracks = async () => {\r\n  const { access_token } = await getAccessToken();\r\n\r\n  return fetch(TOP_TRACKS_ENDPOINT, {\r\n    headers: {\r\n      Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Creating an API Route\r\n\r\nLet's test our communication with Spotify.\r\nFirst, create a new file at `pages/api/top-tracks.js`.\r\nThen, import the new function `getTopTracks`.\r\n\r\n```js:pages/api/top-tracks.js\r\nimport { getTopTracks } from '../../lib/spotify';\r\n\r\nexport default async (_, res) => {\r\n  const response = await getTopTracks();\r\n  const { items } = await response.json();\r\n\r\n  const tracks = items.slice(0, 10).map((track) => ({\r\n    artist: track.artists.map((_artist) => _artist.name).join(', '),\r\n    songUrl: track.external_urls.spotify,\r\n    title: track.name\r\n  }));\r\n\r\n  return res.status(200).json({ tracks });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will return the first ten top tracks, formatted to remove unnecessary information.\r\nFeel free to modify this as you see fit.\r\nIf everything worked correctly, you should see some data like this after running `next dev`.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n// https://leerob.io/api/top-tracks\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"tracks\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"artist\": \"Jamie xx\",\r\n      \"songUrl\": \"https://open.spotify.com/track/77Ezu3tBE7gmzQ4mRnZZUf\",\r\n      \"title\": \"The Rest Is Noise\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"artist\": \"Surfaces\",\r\n      \"songUrl\": \"https://open.spotify.com/track/0NjSiGW8b5HYFfjdCbZzbg\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Horizons\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nYou can view an example on my [dashboard](/dashboard).\r\nThe source code is available [here](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/master/lib/spotify.ts).\r\n",

[Resources](/blog/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems#resources)\r\n\r\n## Why Should You Care?\r\n\r\nEvery website starts simple. There's maybe one page with a few distinct pieces. It has modest intentions.\r\n\r\n<a aria-label=\"Website Mockup\" href=\"https://refactoringui.com/\">\r\n  <Image\r\n    alt={`Website Mockup`}\r\n    src={`/static/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/website.png`}\r\n    width={1467}\r\n    height={878}\r\n  />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nThen, slowly, it begins to scale.\r\n\r\nMore pages are added and new features are built. There might even be multiple teams devoted to specific sections of the site. You could be developing for mobile, too.\r\n\r\nYou start to notice the buttons in one part of the site are slightly different than everywhere else. One team decides to build a feature that another team has (unknowingly) already completed. Communication breakdowns happen. Consistency is lost.\r\n\r\nIs this a preventable problem? Absolutely. Yet, why does it happen over and over again? **Unless you think about your design and development process upfront, you will run into issues later as you scale.**\r\n\r\nTo prevent this issue from happening, or to fix the existing lack of consistency in your products, you need three things:\r\n\r\n- **Style Guide**\r\n- **Component Library**\r\n- **Design System**\r\n\r\nDon't worry if you have no idea what I'm talking about yet. By the end of this article, you'll have consumed almost a year's worth of trial & error, research, and development.\r\n\r\n## What Is a Style Guide?\r\n\r\n<a\r\n  aria-label=\"Style Guide\"\r\n  href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/6161977-BlueVine-Product-Style-Guide\"\r\n>\r\n  <Image\r\n    alt={`Style Guide`}\r\n    src={`/static/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/style-guide.png`}\r\n    width={1468}\r\n    height={1101}\r\n  />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nA **style guide** is a set of rules for how your brand should be displayed. This is both visual (design & imagery) as well as written content (voice & tone).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a style guide is to **allow multiple contributors to create content clearly that cohesively represents the brand**. Almost every major brand has a style guide, though not all are public.\r\n\r\n## What is a Component Library?\r\n\r\n<a aria-label=\"Component Library\" href=\"https://eva.design/\">\r\n  <Image\r\n    alt={`Component Library`}\r\n    src={`/static/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/components.png`}\r\n    width={1000}\r\n    height={376}\r\n  />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nA **component library** is living, breathing implementation of your style guide. It's a shared set of UI components that developers can consume to build applications reflecting your brand. Some notable benefits:\r\n\r\n- Having a component library means less custom code for consumers.\r\n- Since there's a central location, you can ensure all components meet accessibility requirements.\r\n- Components become more robust with multiple contributors submitting bug fixes and improvements in a single place.\r\n- Less duplication of code allows you to ship new products and rewrite legacy code faster.\r\n\r\n## What is a Design System?\r\n\r\nA **design system** is a complete set of standards, documentation, and principles along with the components to achieve those standards. It is the **marriage between your style guide and component library**. One of the most popular design systems is Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/design/).\r\n\r\n<a\r\n  aria-label=\"Design System\"\r\n  href=\"https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/design-systems-vs-pattern-libraries-vs-style-guides-whats-difference/\"\r\n>\r\n  <Image\r\n    alt={`Design System`}\r\n    src={`/static/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/design-system.png`}\r\n    width={1400}\r\n    height={900}\r\n  />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nA design system should contain:\r\n\r\n- **Content** -- The language to design a more thoughtful product experience.\r\n- **Design** -- The visual elements of the design system.\r\n- **Components** -- The building blocks for developing new products and features.\r\n- **Patterns** -- The individual pieces for creating meaningful product experiences.\r\n\r\n## Where Should You Begin?\r\n\r\nDepending on the state of your company/product, you might have a different starting point. This is the outline before we dive into specifics.\r\n\r\n- Create an inventory of existing design patterns.\r\n- Establish design principles and begin a style guide.\r\n- Define your design tokens.\r\n- Create or identify an icon set.\r\n- Choose languages/frameworks supported.\r\n- Evaluate Monorepo vs. single package.\r\n- Evaluate CSS/Sass vs. CSS-in-JS.\r\n- Create a component library.\r\n- Choose a documentation platform.\r\n- Write design system documentation.\r\n\r\n## Building the Design System\r\n\r\n### Create an inventory of existing design patterns.\r\n\r\nUnless you are starting from scratch, you will need to identify all the design patterns currently in use in your interface and document any inconsistencies.\r\nThe goal should be the same user experience regardless of which part of the product the user is in.\r\n\r\nStart documenting and reviewing these amongst your team and identifying your preferred interaction patterns.\r\nThis should start to paint a picture of which pieces your style guide will need.\r\n\r\n### Establish design principles and begin a style guide.\r\n\r\nIt's time to translate these findings into the beginnings of a style guide. You can use tools like:\r\n\r\n- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)\r\n- [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)\r\n- [Framer](https://www.framer.com/)\r\n- [Abobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)\r\n\r\nMy recommendation would be **Figma**, but it's ultimately up to your team and company. Here's some helpful [Figma for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7QHLShNqIXL1Cgbxj7HlN4) tutorials.\r\n\r\n### Define your design tokens.\r\n\r\n<a aria-label=\"Design Tokens\" href=\"https://www.antforfigma.com/\">\r\n  <Image\r\n    alt={`Design Tokens`}\r\n    src={`/static/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/design-tokens.png`}\r\n    width={1080}\r\n    height={810}\r\n  />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system --- specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.\r\n\r\nThis includes things like:\r\n\r\n- [Colors](https://colors.eva.design/) (text, backgrounds, borders)\r\n- [Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)\r\n- [Typography sizes](http://spencermortensen.com/articles/typographic-scale/)\r\n- [Spacing values](https://builttoadapt.io/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-d2573cde8632)\r\n- [Shadows](https://material.io/design/environment/light-shadows.html)\r\n\r\nFor example, take a look at [Vercel's Design System](https://vercel.com/design).\r\n\r\n```css\r\n--geist-foreground: #000;\r\n--geist-background: #fff;\r\n--accents-1: #fafafa;\r\n--accents-2: #eaeaea;\r\n--accents-3: #999999;\r\n--accents-4: #888888;\r\n--accents-5: #666666;\r\n--accents-6: #444444;\r\n--accents-7: #333333;\r\n--accents-8: #111111;\r\n--geist-success: #0070f3;\r\n--geist-error: #ee0000;\r\n--geist-warning: #f5a623;\r\n--dropdown-box-shadow: 0 4px 4px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02);\r\n--dropdown-triangle-stroke: #fff;\r\n--scroller-start: var(--geist-background);\r\n--scroller-end: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\r\n--shadow-small: 0 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);\r\n--shadow-medium: 0 8px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);\r\n--shadow-large: 0 30px 60px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);\r\n--portal-opacity: 0.25;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is now a shared language between designers and developers.\r\n\r\n### Create or identify an icon set.\r\n\r\n<a\r\n  aria-label=\"Icon set\"\r\n  href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/6632346-Zoom-Redesign-Icon-Library\"\r\n>\r\n  <Image\r\n    alt={`Icon set`}\r\n    src={`/static/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/icons.png`}\r\n    width={800}\r\n    height={600}\r\n  />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nIf you already have existing icons, you'll need to determine which to keep. It might not make sense to create your own icons depending on the size and priorities of your company. You might be better off utilizing an open-source icon library. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)\r\n- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)\r\n- [Material UI Icons](https://material-ui.com/components/icons/)\r\n- [Eva Icons](https://akveo.github.io/eva-icons/)\r\n- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com)\r\n- [Styled Icons](https://styled-icons.js.org/)\r\n- [Ikonate](https://ikonate.com/)\r\n\r\nRegardless if you build your own or use open source, you should standardize on usage and identify consumption patterns. It's also worth considering who are the end-users of your icons set - designers, developers, and marketing?\r\n\r\nUsing SVGs, you can make the icon library your single source of truth. Your process might look like this:\r\n\r\n1.  Designers create/provide raw SVGs.\r\n2.  Optimize and compress the SVGs using [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo/).\r\n3.  Automatically create React components using [SVGR](https://github.com/smooth-code/svgr) for developers.\r\n4.  Output PNGs and JPEGs at different sizes/resolutions for marketing.\r\n5.  Compile SVGs into a [bundled font](https://www.npmjs.com/package/icon-font-generator) for mobile applications to use.\r\n\r\n### Choose languages/frameworks supported.\r\n\r\nWhat languages or frameworks are you currently supporting? Which should the component library support?\r\nIt's important to think about this ahead of time so you can properly architecture your library.\r\n\r\nIf you have an application which uses script tags instead of [ES Modules](https://flaviocopes.com/es-modules/), then you'll need to\r\nconfigure your component library to bundle into a single distributable file. For example,\r\na vanilla JavaScript application would need something like this in an HTML file.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"/js/component-library.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, you can use either [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).\r\nI would recommend Webpack, as it's the industry standard. I'd also recommend [TSDX](https://github.com/formium/tsdx) if you want to use TypeScript.\r\n\r\n### Evaluate Monorepo vs. single package.\r\n\r\nA [Monorepo](/blog/turborepo-design-system-monorepo) allows you to build and publish multiple libraries from a single repo.  While it does solve some very real problems, it also creates others. It's important to understand the pros and cons.\r\n\r\n<a\r\n  aria-label=\"Monorepo\"\r\n  href=\"https://www.toptal.com/front-end/guide-to-monorepos\"\r\n>\r\n  <Image\r\n    alt={`Monorepo`}\r\n    src={`/static/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/monorepo.png`}\r\n    width={1467}\r\n    height={583}\r\n  />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n<ProsCard\r\n  title=\"a monorepo\"\r\n  pros={[\r\n    'Small bundle sizes by decreasing the scope of components included in one package.',\r\n    'Shared built, lint, test, and release process for multiple packages versus separate repositories with duplicated code.',\r\n    'More granular control of semver on a package-by-package basis.'\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<ConsCard\r\n  title=\"a monorepo\"\r\n  cons={[\r\n    'Additional tooling and infrastructure needed.',\r\n    'Consumers are required to import from a variety of packages instead of one single component library.',\r\n    `Cutting edge technology. There is industry adoption, but you can run into issues very few have experienced without a clear path for a solution.`\r\n  ]}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nSome questions that will help you identify which solution is right for your company.\r\n\r\n- Do you currently have multiple repositories all publishing to NPM?\r\n- Is your build, test, lint infrastructure complex? Is it duplicated in many places?\r\n- How many repositories do you have (or plan to have in the next year?)\r\n- How large is your team? How many people will be consuming the component library?\r\n- Will it be open-source? Can you lean on others in the industry to help solve problems?\r\n- Do you see the need for multiple packages in the future? (e.g. icons, [codemods](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift), etc)\r\n\r\nFor most smaller companies, I would argue that a Monorepo is unnecessary. It has its time and place. [I've used it before](/blog/turborepo-design-system-monorepo) with (~150 developers) to distribute 10 different packages at once, spanning both internal and external apps.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Want to use a Monorepo? Check out [Building a Design System Monorepo with Turborepo](/blog/turborepo-design-system-monorepo).\r\n\r\n### Evaluate CSS/Sass vs. CSS-in-JS.\r\n\r\nCSS-in-JS is the easiest solution for bundling styles and distributing through NPM.\r\nFor optimal performance, consider using a near-zero runtime solution like [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/).\r\n\r\nIf your component library needs to output raw HTML/CSS, I'd recommend sticking with Sass. A great example of this is IBM's [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/code).\r\nYou can use [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) to contain your [design tokens](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/).\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Design System Button`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/button.png`}\r\n  width={821}\r\n  height={154}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button class=\"bx--btn bx--btn--primary\" type=\"button\">Button</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using React, check out [How Should I Style My React Application?](/blog/css-with-react)\r\n\r\n### Create a component library.\r\n\r\nWith your technical requirements defined and your style guide started, you should now be able\r\nto begin constructing a component library. My recommendation would be to use **React alongside [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)**.\r\n\r\n<a aria-label=\"Component Driven Development\" href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">\r\n  <Image\r\n    alt={`Component Driven Development`}\r\n    src={`/static/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/component-driven-development.jpg`}\r\n    width={1000}\r\n    height={537}\r\n  />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n**Creating a component library is much more than just translating the style guide into code.**\r\n\r\nYou'll need to think about how consumers will interact with your components.\r\nWhat sort of API would they expect? What provides the most clarity and is self-documenting?\r\nFor example, consider buttons. You have different variations of buttons - primary, secondary, etc.\r\n\r\n<a aria-label=\"Buttons\" href=\"https://eva.design/\">\r\n  <Image\r\n    alt={`Buttons`}\r\n    src={`/static/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/buttons.png`}\r\n    width={1000}\r\n    height={641}\r\n  />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nShould you have separate components for each?\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<PrimaryButton>Hello World!</PrimaryButton>\r\n<SecondaryButton>Hello World!</SecondaryButton>\r\n```\r\n\r\nor should you use a prop?\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Button>Hello World!</Button>\r\n<Button variant=\"secondary\">Hello World!</Button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecondarily, what should the prop be called? `variant`? `type`? Did you consider that type is a [reserved attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_button_type.asp) for the HTML `<button>` element? These are the type of decisions that you will need to make as you build your component library.\r\n\r\nSome other things you might want to consider:\r\n\r\n- Should you allow consumers to [pass CSS properties](https://evergreen.segment.com/components/layout-primitives) in as props to the React components, or should they have to extend/wrap components to achieve their desired styling? If you choose the former, consider [styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system).\r\n- Should you build loading states [directly into components](http://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/accordion--skeleton), or should there be a [generic component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loading-skeleton) for loading (spinner, skeleton?)\r\n- How should you test purely visual components? [Snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing)? [Visual diff testing](https://www.chromaticqa.com/)?\r\n- What will consumers need to do to integrate with your component library? Should there be a [global style reset](https://cssreset.com/what-is-a-css-reset/)? Should they add any [Babel plugins](https://github.com/ant-design/babel-plugin-import)?\r\n- Should you utilize [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) to auto-generate a changelog?\r\n- Will your components need to support web _and_ mobile? Consider using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) to share code across platforms.\r\n\r\n### Choose a documentation platform.\r\n\r\nYou need a platform to display your design system.\r\nIf you're just getting started, I would recommend using **[Storybook Docs](https://medium.com/storybookjs/storybook-docs-sneak-peak-5be78445094a)**.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Storybook Docs`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/storybook-docs.png`}\r\n  width={1000}\r\n  height={614}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThis combination will achieve the output as other similar platforms like [Docz](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz), [Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/), and [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).\r\n\r\n- Easily copy code snippets from component examples\r\n- Auto-generate a props table based on `prop-types` and `defaultProps`\r\n- Easily view all permutations of a component\r\n- Write custom docs using MDX\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Storybook Flow`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/storybook-flow.png`}\r\n  width={1300}\r\n  height={378}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nIf you're adamant on your design system reflecting your brand and dogfooding your component library,\r\nI would recommend a custom solution using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). This will allow you to insert React components\r\ninside Markdown files. The blog you're reading right now [uses this](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io).\r\n\r\nHaving a truly custom solution allows you full control over your docs.\r\nOne example I'm extremely impressed by is [Atomize React](https://atomizecode.com/docs/react/atoms).\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Atomize React`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/atomize.png`}\r\n  width={1300}\r\n  height={675}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n### Write design system documentation.\r\n\r\nNow that you've chosen a documentation platform, it's time to write the docs. You should include:\r\n\r\n- Installation and setup instruction for the component library\r\n- Props schemas and type definitions for each component\r\n- Component examples along with copyable code snippets\r\n- Technology choices and rationale\r\n\r\nConsider also adding:\r\n\r\n- A \"Getting Started\" section involving a tutorial\r\n- Completed UI templates to choose from\r\n- Information about theming\r\n- A live code playground for interacting with components\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nI've spent a lot of time in the past year thinking about design systems.\r\nBuilding a component library from the ground up gave me a new appreciation\r\nfor the amount of work that goes into front-end development and design.\r\nBelow, you'll find a list of design systems which have inspired me and serve as great resources.\r\n\r\nFeel free to [reach out](mailto:me@leerob.io) if you wanna chat about building design systems.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n**Design Systems**\r\n\r\n- [Shopify's Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/)\r\n- [Segment's Evergreen](https://evergreen.segment.com/)\r\n- [Eva Design](https://eva.design)\r\n- [Vercel's Design System](https://vercel.com/design)\r\n- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)\r\n- [IBM's Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/)\r\n- [Storybook's Design System](https://github.com/storybookjs/design-system)\r\n- [Modulz's Radix](https://radix.modulz.app/docs/getting-started/)\r\n- [GitHub's Primer](https://primer.style/)\r\n- [Palantir's Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/)\r\n- [Atlassian's Design System](https://atlassian.design/)\r\n- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)\r\n",

    "summary": "Learn why I switched my Next.js blog to use Tailwind CSS and how it impacted performance.",
    "image": "/static/images/tailwind/banner.png",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\r\nMy site is an opportunity to try new tech and form opinions on what I enjoy using. I learn best by building real things. After some evaluation, I've landed on the following tech stack:\r\n\r\n- Next.js (Upgraded to `v10`)\r\n- Tailwind CSS (Switched from Chakra UI)\r\n- `next-mdx-remote` (Switched from `next-mdx-enhanced`)\r\n- Deployed with Vercel\r\n\r\nI've improved performance, added new features, and cleaned up some code. Let's dive into why I chose this tech stack.\r\n\r\n### Next.js 10\r\n\r\nNext.js 10 introduced the [Image Component and Automatic Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization). I've optimized images manually before (using ImageAlpha / ImageOptim) as well as with automated tools (like ImgBot). With Next.js 10, I no longer need to worry about that.\r\n\r\nThe `Image` component helps prevent [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS) by defining the `width` and `height` ahead of time. No more jumping layouts. It only loads images as they're scrolled into the viewport, keeping page loads fast. Plus, images are served in modern formats like [WebP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types) when the browser supports it.\r\n\r\nPreventing CLS required a mental model shift. Previously, my images used normal Markdown image syntax and expanded to fill the width of their container (`700px`). For example:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n![Siamese Cat](/cat.png)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wanted to avoid using the `height` and `width` props of `next/image`, if possible. The `Image` component exposes different [layout props](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#layout) like `layout=fill`, which led to me believe I could [escape defining sizes](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/image-component/pages/layout-fill.js). In reality, there's no way to avoid layout shift unless you explicitly tell the layout how much space to allocate. Once that clicked in my head, the `Image` component made sense.\r\n\r\nThis meant switching from Markdown image syntax (shown above) to using `next/image` via MDX. Since I had hundreds of Markdown files, I wanted to automate this. I created a [Node script using remark](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/fb9c02b76128d91717a226e5c118b5c56e11696e/scripts/markdown-to-next-image.js) that transformed every image and read the dimensions from the file system. For example, the above Markdown image was transformed to:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Image alt=\"Siamese Cat\" src=\"/cat.png\" height={50} width={50} />\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tailwind CSS\r\n\r\nAt first glance, Tailwind seems horrible. I've heard this sentiment many times and read [Adam's rebuttals](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/). Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to try Tailwind on a project. I didn't hate it. Still, I needed a larger project to form an opinion on the framework.\r\n\r\nWell, the verdict is out. **I really enjoy Tailwind.** There was a learning curve as I tried to translate my existing CSS knowledge to Tailwind specific naming. For example, this vanilla CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\ndisplay: flex;\r\nflex-direction: row;\r\nalign-items: center;\r\n```\r\n\r\ntranslates to these utility classes with Tailwind:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<div className=\"flex flex-row items-center\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Tailwind classes feel intuitive and their documentation makes it easy. The underlying idea of being bound to a design system made plenty of sense coming from Chakra UI. For example:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport { Flex } from '@chakra-ui/react';\r\n\r\n<Flex px={4} py={2} />;\r\n```\r\n\r\nChakra's [spacing system](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/theme#spacing) is inspired by Tailwind. 1 spacing unit is equal to `0.25rem`, which translates to `4px` by default in most browsers. In the example below, we're adding `16px` of horizontal padding and `8px` of vertical padding.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<div className=\"px-4 py-2\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nI still enjoy Chakra for larger applications. Having pre-built UI components saves a lot of time. Their documentation has some good notes on the [differences between Tailwind](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/comparison#how-is-chakra-different-from-tailwind-css). For further reading, check out [How Should I Style My React Application?](/blog/css-with-react).\r\n\r\n### Dark Mode\r\n\r\nTailwind 2.0 makes using dark mode painless. Enable the `dark` [variant](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) and prefix your classes with `dark:`. That's pretty much it.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-800\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was able to keep a [dark mode toggle](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/91233631f0e1a193295ffc54d2291f3109060007/components/Container.tsx) in the navigation thanks to [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes). Tailwind and `next-themes` [pair well](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes#with-tailwind) together.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport { useTheme } from 'next-themes';\r\n\r\nconst ThemeChanger = () => {\r\n  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      The current theme is: {theme}\r\n      <button onClick={() => setTheme('light')}>Light Mode</button>\r\n      <button onClick={() => setTheme('dark')}>Dark Mode</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hit a few issues along the way adding dark mode to Tailwind Typography. The documentation felt a bit disjointed from the rest of Tailwind. I would have expected more guidance on pairing the two together.\r\n\r\nAfter digging through GitHub Issues, I was able to [get things working](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/91233631f0e1a193295ffc54d2291f3109060007/tailwind.config.js). It wasn't obvious I needed `dark:prose-dark`. I also managed to get [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/91233631f0e1a193295ffc54d2291f3109060007/styles/global.css) working through some custom styles.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nLibraries like `emotion` and `styled-system` require runtime JavaScript to compute styles and generate class names. That doesn't mean you can't use [CSS-in-JS](https://github.com/callstack/linaria) [correctly](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro). But I'd argue using \"plain\" CSS helps you fall into the [pit of success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/) ([CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support), Tailwind, etc) more easily.\r\n\r\nThere is no correct answer. Each has their own tradeoffs. For my simple site, I choose the performance tradeoff. I was able to reduce the [number of assets downloaded](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli#build) **by 43%**.\r\n\r\n- 📦 Before → `~150kb` First Load JS\r\n- 📈 After → `~85kb` First Load JS\r\n\r\nThis change, paired with `next/image`, has my [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics) looking incredible. Zero CLS.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Vercel Analytics`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/tailwind/analytics.jpg`}\r\n  width={1000}\r\n  height={782}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nI'm also evaluating using Preact in the [client-side production build](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/commit/74a3ebb14b81f785ea96f9c73fbe4f6c2463679c). This prevents needing [next-plugin-preact](https://github.com/preactjs/next-plugin-preact) to handle SSR and HMR ([source](https://blogify.dev/egoist/how-i-made-my-next-js-build-50-percent-smaller)). So far, I haven't noticed any issues with my small site and the results are promising. **39% smaller**.\r\n\r\n- 📦 Before → `~85kb` First Load JS\r\n- 📈 After → `~52kb` First Load JS\r\n\r\n### MDX\r\n\r\n[Last year](/blog/mdx), I switched from using `@next/mdx` to `next-mdx-enhanced` mostly for front matter and layout support. These are now both [solved problems](https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown). Given that [next-mdx-enhanced](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced) will likely be deprecated soon (see below) I wanted to explore [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote).\r\n\r\n> You probably should be using `next-mdx-remote` instead of this library. It is ~50% faster, more flexible with content storage, does not induce memory issues at scale, and fits much better with the way that data is intended to flow through Next.js.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of `getStaticPaths` / `getServerSideProps`, you can treat your MDX data like any other data source in Next.js. It also removes the limitation of being bound to [file-system based routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) for your `.mdx` files. Since my site has hundreds of MDX files, moving these to a top-level `data/` folder made more sense to me.\r\n\r\nStill, the MDX experience feels _fragmented_. I'd like to merge `next-mdx-remote` with `@next/mdx` so there are fewer options. [nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) (another related project) allows you to use methods like `getStaticProps` directly inside your MDX files. Maybe there's a path to convergence for all three.\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n\r\nI added [absolute Imports and module path aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases) to improve the readability of nested imports inside files. Here's a before and after example:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n// Before\r\nimport db from '../../lib/db-admin';\r\n\r\n// After\r\nimport db from 'lib/db-admin';\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also merged my previous project (jamstackfns) directly into this site with a new section called [Snippets](/snippets)! These are interesting pieces of code that didn't justify writing an entire blog post. For example, here's a few snippets I've added recently:\r\n\r\n- [React hook for storing a search value with Context](/snippets/search)\r\n- [React hook for displaying loading progress](/snippets/loading-progress)\r\n- [React hook to parse an email from a URL](/snippets/email-query-params)\r\n- [Gradient border with CSS](/snippets/gradient-border)\r\n- [Sticky navigation with CSS](/snippets/sticky-nav)\r\n- [CRUD Next.js API route](/snippets/crud-api-route)\r\n",

Today, I've taught students all over the world and **made over $7,000 teaching online.**\r\n\r\nYou can do the same. Here's my story.\r\n\r\n## Writing Online\r\n\r\nI've been [writing online](/blog) since 2014. I would condense and simplify pieces of information I learned into helpful articles.\r\nAt the time, I wrote for myself––I needed to keep my skills sharp.\r\n\r\nI repurposed the knowledge I was paid to learn at work into content for others.\r\nAfter five years of writing online, I hadn't made a single dollar. All of the content I produced was free.\r\nI saw other creators [making millions](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/098-adam-wathan-of-refactoring-ui) teaching online. Why couldn't I do the same?\r\n\r\nI realized I hadn't been giving away my content for free. I was building an audience and establishing credibility.\r\n\r\n## Credibility\r\n\r\nWriting online is difficult. Clearly explaining technical content is twice as hard.\r\nYou have to understand the subject deep enough that you can explain it at an entry-level. Many fail at this.\r\n\r\nOver the past six years, I created my niche with front-end web development.\r\nI started a [small newsletter](/newsletter) where I'd share my latest writing with my audience.\r\nI'd distribute my content to [social media](https://twitter.com/leeerob). Occasionally, a post would go viral on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/cn8c3l/everything_i_know_about_style_guides_design/) or [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23079289).\r\n\r\nSlowly, I became credible in my niche. My tutorials and blog posts [helped others learn](/blog/why-i-create-open-source-software).\r\nI established myself as an \"expert\". I say expert, but you can do this.\r\n\r\nMost people spend the majority of their time online consuming instead of creating. Be a creator.\r\nI focused on writing about topics I found interesting. Along the way, I built an audience.\r\n\r\n## Building an Audience through Learning\r\n\r\nWhen I learned something new, I would share it––with my [newsletter](/newsletter), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leeerob), everywhere.\r\nI gave value to my audience. The content I created for myself was now a reference for others.\r\n\r\nOver time, this grew into a hub of inbound traffic to my website.\r\nToday, over [80% of my traffic](/dashboard) comes from organic Google Searches.\r\n**Without an audience, you cannot sell a product.**\r\nBe helpful on the internet and you will create an audience.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 2019, I became obsessed with a specific technology called [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).\r\nIt allowed me to create websites faster. I rebuilt my website using it and documented the process along the way.\r\nI continued to write about Next.js that year. In September, I realized I'd found my niche.\r\n\r\n## Finding Your Market\r\n\r\nIt's impossible to measure your success if you can't [track it](/dashboard).\r\nWhatever your metric is (post views, number of likes), you need a baseline to improve.\r\n\r\nI use [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/ref/T93GOJ) and Google Search Console to monitor the performance of my site.\r\nI'm able to see which articles perform best and how people find my site.\r\nTo my surprise, almost all of my highest ranked articles were about [Next.js](/blog/things-ive-learned-building-nextjs-apps). I'd found my market.\r\n\r\nCreating demand is hard. Filling demand is much easier.\r\nDon’t create a product, then seek someone to sell it to. Find a market—define your customers—then find or develop a product for them.\r\n\r\n## Creating a Course\r\n\r\nThe idea of creating an online course seemed daunting. It would take six months, at least.\r\nBased on my analytics, people were interested––but would they buy it?\r\n\r\nAfter researching teaching online and marketing, I had a eureka moment.\r\nTo figure out if people would buy the course, I would launch it. _Now._\r\nWhy should I treat this course any different than a software product?\r\nWith software, you can start small and rapidly iterate over time. I applied the same methodology to the course.\r\n\r\nFirst, I defined the content. I created an outline for the course I wish I had when starting to learn Next.js.\r\nWorking backward, I made a list of 15-20 main concepts to cover.\r\nThen, I [created a website](https://masteringnextjs.com/) to market the course and allow people to pre-order.\r\nThe main benefit of your course should be explainable in one sentence or phrase. How is it different, and why should I buy it?\r\n\r\nOn November 3rd, [I launched the course](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1191131502131765249).\r\n\r\nI placed a small bet––only 15-20% of the content was finished. If this launch failed and no one bought the course,\r\nI'd cut my losses and walk away. Instead of wasting the next six months, I wanted validation now people would pay for this.\r\n\r\nI intentionally priced the course high at $199, with a launch price of $99. With ten pre-orders, I'd have $1,000 of revenue.\r\nNo cards were charged––I wasn't stealing their money. I was validating my idea and confirming I had a market.\r\nWith no idea how long it would take to create the course, I set a launch date of April 2020.\r\n\r\n**Two days after the launch, I had my first sale.** It was breathtaking.\r\nSomeone on the internet spent $100 on a digital asset I created. I couldn't believe it.\r\n\r\nThe next day, another sale. And another the day after.\r\nIn the first week, I made seven sales for $700 in profit. I was motivated to continue working.\r\n\r\n## Should I Use A Platform?\r\n\r\nYou'll need to make two platform choices: how to accept payments and where to host content.\r\nFor payments, I'd recommend [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/), [Paddle](https://paddle.com/), or [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).\r\nDepending on your volume of sales, there are different processing fees.\r\n[This article](https://activegrowth.com/stripe-vs-paypal-vs-gumroad-how-to-sell-ebooks/) goes more in-depth about how fees compare across platforms.\r\n\r\nThe second decision is where to host your content.\r\nFor e-books or a small number of videos, I'd recommend Gumroad.\r\nIf you have a large video course, YouTube (with private videos) worked well for me.\r\nAnother option is a fully-managed online course platform like [Teachable](https://teachable.com/).\r\n\r\n## Marketing & Advertising\r\n\r\n[Writing online](/blog/content-marketing-personal-brand) was effective at growing my site, so I took the same approach for the course.\r\nI wrote [three articles](https://masteringnextjs.com/blog) to attract inbound traffic from social media and search engines.\r\nI released a [26-minute introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQeidE2LA1s) on YouTube.\r\nNot only did this promote the course, but it further established my credibility. The video has over 2,500 views, almost all from organic searches.\r\n\r\nProviding value by giving is the fastest way to grow.\r\nIf your audience has learned from you, they'll want more.\r\nOnly after you've provided value can you sell a product.\r\nTo give back, I ran a [Twitter giveaway](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1216020603020378113) for the course. Initially, I planned for five winners.\r\nThe response was so overwhelming that I ended up giving away ten instead.\r\n\r\nI spent $0 and reached 7,331 potential customers. Here's the full statistics on that tweet.\r\n\r\n- Impressions: 7,331\r\n- Engagements: 488\r\n- Detail expands: 119\r\n- Profile clicks: 101\r\n- Link clicks: 72\r\n\r\nI realized it was time to spend money on advertising.\r\n\r\n## Advertising\r\n\r\nMy first attempt at advertising was through [Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/home/).\r\nAgain, I started with a small bet of $5/day. The initial results were promising.\r\n\r\n- Impressions: 5,255\r\n- Clicks: 24\r\n- Ad Spend: $26.75\r\n- Sales: 2 x ($99)\r\n- Profit: **$171.25**\r\n\r\nComparing impressions against Twitter shows how valuable of an asset it can be.\r\nI continued advertising with Google, increasing the daily spend to $20/day for another week. Here are the final numbers.\r\n\r\n- Impressions: 53,357\r\n- Clicks: 189\r\n- Ad Spend: $208.91\r\n- Sales: 6 x ($99)\r\n- Profit: **$385**\r\n\r\nI also tried [Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising). I iterated over a few ads with this approach.\r\n\r\n1. Use A/B tests to try different ads\r\n1. Take the ad with a higher click-through rate\r\n1. Rinse and repeat\r\n\r\nI'd optimize each ad by targeting specific subreddits.\r\nFor example, this subreddit had twice the click-through rate for the same cost-per-click.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Reddit ad results`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/teach-online/reddit.png`}\r\n  width={699}\r\n  height={277}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nEven though I was new to advertising, it played a critical role in growing the course.\r\nNow, I needed to launch.\r\n\r\n## Launch Day\r\n\r\nFor months, I worked closely with early customers to get feedback on the course.\r\nFeeling confident, I soft-launched with 95% of the content finished.\r\n\r\nAfter a week with no issues, it was time for the real launch.\r\nI posted to [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mastering-next-js), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/f2jbek/launched_a_programming_video_course_and_made_2000/), [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/mastering-next-js), and everywhere else I could.\r\nBy the time I had launched, I had $2,000 in pre-orders.\r\n\r\n**Ten days later, I broke $3,000.**\r\n\r\nWhen I started the course, my original goal was $5,000 _in total_.\r\nI thought that seemed aggressive. In retrospect, I aimed too low.\r\nNever underestimate the power of teaching online.\r\n\r\nSince launching in February 2020, I've surpassed $7,000 in revenue.\r\nI'm averaging ~$1,500/month, putting me on track to make **$18,000 this year**.\r\n\r\n## You Should Teach Online\r\n\r\nThere's never been a better time to become a creator.\r\nBlog posts, YouTube videos, courses, podcasts, streaming––if you have something others find value in, share it.\r\nPublish that article. Make that video.\r\n\r\nStop waiting for a once in a lifetime idea and start teaching others online today.\r\nThe opportunity outweighs your fears. Even if your audience is small, teaching others\r\nwill improve your understanding of the subject.\r\n\r\nMy story isn't unique. Here are some other creators that inspired me.\r\n\r\n- [Adam Wathan](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/098-adam-wathan-of-refactoring-ui) made $2.5MM from books/courses.\r\n- [Daniel Vassallo](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1256245508688842752) made $100K from a book and video course.\r\n- [Emma Bostian](https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian/status/1258367502041714689) made $40K before her book even launched.\r\n\r\nNever underestimate the power of teaching online.\r\n",

Why is this?\r\n\r\n## Buying vs. Selling\r\n\r\nHiring is becoming increasingly more difficult, especially in a place with a [limited talent pool](https://innovationia.com/2019/01/03/dsmtech-io-launches-for-tech-job-seekers-scouting-des-moines/) and\r\nthe [lowest unemployment rate](https://whotv.com/2019/01/22/iowa-now-has-the-lowest-unemployment-rate-in-the-nation/) in the nation (2.4%).\r\nThis leads to companies outsourcing or supplementing hiring by working with third parties.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is: **the people you're trying to recruit already have a job**. The focus needs to be on\r\n_selling them_ the position. Let's take a look at some examples. What kind of subject line works best?\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Recruiter Email`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/technical-recruiting-is-broken/recruiter2.jpg`}\r\n  width={1224}\r\n  height={548}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nWhat does that even mean?

When a recruiter leaves a positive impression,\r\nI'm more likely to return to them when the timing is right.\r\n\r\nRather than dwell on the negatives, I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight some positive messages I've received\r\nfrom recruiters and CEOs.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Technical Recruiter`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/technical-recruiting-is-broken/derek.jpg`}\r\n  width={976}\r\n  height={414}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n- He creates a personal connection by reference my writing he's read\r\n- He compliments me on my skill sets\r\n- He asks to _learn about me_ instead of plugging a specific job\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Technical Recruiter`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/technical-recruiting-is-broken/alexa.jpg`}\r\n  width={1638}\r\n  height={578}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n- She captures my attention with a great subject line\r\n- She read my profile to see that I'm into music\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Technical Recruiter`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/technical-recruiting-is-broken/katie.jpg`}\r\n  width={972}\r\n  height={482}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n- She understands the [benefits I'm looking for](/blog/benefits-i-care-about-in-2019) by reading my blog\r\n- She offers to connect me with a developer\r\n\r\n## Takeaways\r\n\r\n_What can recruiters do to fix technical recruiting?_\r\n\r\n- Make genuine, personal connections\r\n- Focus on building relationships more than solving immediate needs\r\n- Do your research on candidates (look at their website, read their blog, etc)\r\n\r\n_What can recruitees do?_\r\n\r\n- Just because there are bad recruiters out there does not mean they're all bad - acknowledge and support those who recruit well and develop relationships\r\n- Clearly state what you're looking for and what you don't want\r\n- No false advertising - be able to speak to everything on your resume and LinkedIn\r\n\r\nSee more discussion on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/arn2pg/technical_recruiting_is_broken/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19185816).\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\nI've spent a lot of time in the past 4 months creating [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) apps for both work and personal use.\r\n\r\n- I ported over my personal site from [Hugo](/blog/migrating-to-hugo) to [Next.js + MDX](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io).\r\n- I created [dsmtech.io](https://dsmtech.io/) (and explored using [Mapbox](/blog/using-mapbox-with-next-js)).\r\n- A handful of projects at [Hy-Vee](https://innovate.hy-vee.com/) are being [rebuilt with Next.js](https://stackshare.io/hy-vee/hy-vee-aisles-online).\r\n\r\nAlong that journey, I've grown to really ❤ Next.js and it's ecosystem. Here are some of the things I've learned along the way.\r\n\r\n## CSS Modules\r\n\r\nI've worked with CSS, Sass, CSS-in-JS, and now CSS Modules. For most applications, I'd recommend CSS Modules.\r\n\r\nCSS Modules prevent naming collisions and keep you from loading excess styling.\r\nThey're built [directly into Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css), making it easy to get started.\r\n\r\nFor more information, check out [How Should I Style My React Application?](/blog/css-with-react)\r\n\r\n## Font Loading\r\n\r\nBy using `@font-face` in combination with the `font-display` [attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display), I can prevent FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text) and FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text).\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@font-face {\r\n  font-family: 'Inter';\r\n  font-style: normal;\r\n  font-weight: 100 900;\r\n  font-display: optional;\r\n  src: url(/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2) format('woff2');\r\n  unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA,\r\n    U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215,\r\n    U+FEFF, U+FFFD;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther, I can [preload](https://web.dev/preload-critical-assets/) my optimized font file in the `Head` of my document.\r\n\r\n```js:pages/_document.js\r\nclass MyDocument extends Document {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <Html lang=\"en\">\r\n        <Head>\r\n          <link\r\n            rel=\"preload\"\r\n            href=\"/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2\"\r\n            as=\"font\"\r\n            type=\"font/woff2\"\r\n            crossOrigin=\"anonymous\"\r\n          />\r\n        </Head>\r\n        <body>\r\n          <Main />\r\n          <NextScript />\r\n        </body>\r\n      </Html>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default MyDocument;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update:** For more information, check out [Web Fonts in 2021](/blog/fonts).\r\n\r\n## Dynamic Imports and Testing\r\n\r\nIt's likely that at some point in scaling your Next.js app, you'll want to use an external package\r\nthat doesn't work well server-side rendered. For me, this package was [react-select](https://react-select.com).\r\n\r\nWhen SSR this component, it simply did not work in Safari. Until that bug is fixed, I needed a workaround. Thanks\r\nto Next's [Dynamic Imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/#dynamic-import), it's easy to import a component and disable SSR.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic';\r\n\r\nconst ReactSelectNoSSR = dynamic(() => import('../components/select'), {\r\n  ssr: false\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default () => (\r\n  <>\r\n    <Header />\r\n    <ReactSelectNoSSR />\r\n    <Footer />\r\n  </>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this works, we can go a step further and provide a [loading placeholder](/blog/loading-placeholder-with-sass) to make the user experience better.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst ReactSelectNoSSR = dynamic(() => import('../components/select'), {\r\n  loading: () => <Input />,\r\n  ssr: false\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## MDX\r\n\r\nMy [portfolio](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) has transformed quite a bit since I started it in 2014. Originally, it was\r\njust static HTML & CSS. Then, I [switched over to Hugo](/blog/migrating-to-hugo) so I could write my posts in Markdown.\r\nThis worked well for a while, but I wanted full control over my layouts and felt much more comfortable with JavaScript.\r\nThat's what led me to Next.js and MDX.\r\n\r\nWith [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), I can use JSX components inside my Markdown documents with ease. This way, if I want to do\r\nsomething custom, it's as simple as importing a React component.\r\n\r\n## Link Prefetching\r\n\r\nFor maximum performance, you can use the `prefetch` [attribute](https://nextjs.org/docs#prefetching-pages) on Next's `<Link>` component. This will give the perception\r\nthe page loads instantly. As of [Next.js 8](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8/), `prefetch` uses `<link rel=\"preload\">` instead of a `<script>` tag. It also only starts prefetching after `onload` to allow the browser to manage resources.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Link prefetch href=\"/\">\r\n  <a>Home</a>\r\n</Link>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update:** Next.js 9 will [automatically prefetch](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#prefetching-in-viewport-links) `<Link>` components as they appear in-viewport. You no longer need to explicitly say `prefetch`.\r\n\r\n## Polyfills\r\n\r\nNext.js supports IE11 and all modern browsers (Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera) out of the box.\r\nHowever, it's possible that your own code or external NPM dependencies might use features not supported in your target browsers. In this case,\r\nyou will need to [add polyfills](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/supported-browsers-features#custom-polyfills).\r\n\r\nYou'll need to add a top-level import for the specific polyfill you need in your Custom `<App>` or the individual component.\r\n\r\n```js:pages/_app.js\r\n\r\n// Add your polyfills here or at the component level.\r\n// For example...\r\n// import 'resize-observer-polyfill'\r\n\r\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\r\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default MyApp\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Vercel\r\n\r\n[Vercel](https://vercel.com) is hands down the **easiest way to deploy applications** I've ever used.\r\nIt's incredibly easy to get started and their GitHub integration will automatically deploy your app on pull requests and leave a link\r\nfor you to review the changes. If everything looks good, it will deploy to prod when the PR is merged. Simple as that.\r\n\r\nThe icing on the cake is how well the Vercel ecosystem works together. Their [domain service](https://vercel.com/domains) allows you\r\nto buy domains _from the command line_. I've never been able to go from an idea to a live, deployed application\r\nhosted on a domain so fast. I was even able to setup email forwarding for my domain and create `me@leerob.io` using [improvmx](https://improvmx.com/) 🎉\r\n\r\n**Update:** I work at Vercel now. This was written before, but still holds true 😁\r\n\r\n## Where To Get Help\r\n\r\nThe Next.js and Vercel community support is _fantastic_. They're very responsive to emails, issues, or any other form\r\nof contact. My preferred method would be [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/discussions). Thanks to Discussions, all\r\nquestions and answers are indexed, searchable, and easy to find. Their [tutorials](https://nextjs.org/learn/) and [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) are also fantastic and well-written.\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources\r\n\r\n- [Mastering Next.js](https://masteringnextjs.com/)\r\n- [React 2025](https://react2025.com/)\r\n- [Official Learn Tutorial](http://nextjs.org/learn)\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\nThis guide explains how to use a React design system starter powered by:\r\n\r\n- 🏎 [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org) — High-performance build system for Monorepos\r\n- 🚀 [React](https://reactjs.org/) — JavaScript library for user interfaces\r\n- 🛠 [Tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) — TypeScript bundler powered by esbuild\r\n- 📖 [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) — UI component environment powered by Vite\r\n\r\nAs well as a few others tools preconfigured:\r\n\r\n- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking\r\n- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting\r\n- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting\r\n- [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for managing versioning and changelogs\r\n- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/changesets/action) for fully automated package publishing\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nClone the design system example locally or [from GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/design-system):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpx degit vercel/turborepo/examples/design-system design-system\r\ncd design-system\r\nyarn install\r\ngit init . && git add . && git commit -m \"Init\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Useful Commands\r\n\r\n- `yarn build` - Build all packages including the Storybook site\r\n- `yarn dev` - Run all packages locally and preview with Storybook\r\n- `yarn lint` - Lint all packages\r\n- `yarn changeset` - Generate a changeset\r\n- `yarn clean` - Clean up all `node_modules` and `dist` folders (runs each package's clean script)\r\n\r\n## Turborepo\r\n\r\n[Turborepo](https://turborepo.org) is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases. It was designed after the workflows used by massive software engineering organizations to ship code at scale. Turborepo abstracts the complex configuration needed for monorepos and provides fast, incremental builds with zero-configuration remote caching.\r\n\r\nUsing Turborepo simplifes managing your design system monorepo, as you can have a single lint, build, test, and release process for all packages. [Learn more](https://vercel.com/blog/monorepos-are-changing-how-teams-build-software) about how monorepos improve your development workflow.\r\n\r\n## Apps & Packages\r\n\r\nThis Turborepo includes the following packages and applications:\r\n\r\n- `apps/docs`: Component documentation site with Storybook\r\n- `packages/@acme/core`: Core React components\r\n- `packages/@acme/utils`: Shared React utilities\r\n- `packages/@acme/tsconfig`: Shared `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the Turborepo\r\n- `packages/eslint-preset-acme`: ESLint preset\r\n\r\nEach package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Yarn Workspaces enables us to \"hoist\" dependencies that are shared between packages to the root `package.json`. This means smaller `node_modules` folders and a better local dev experience. To install a dependency for the entire monorepo, use the `-W` workspaces flag with `yarn add`.\r\n\r\nThis example sets up your `.gitignore` to exclude all generated files, other folders like `node_modules` used to store your dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Compilation\r\n\r\nTo make the core library code work across all browsers, we need to compile the raw TypeScript and React code to plain JavaScript. We can accomplish this with `tsup`, which uses `esbuild` to greatly improve performance.\r\n\r\nRunning `yarn build` from the root of the Turborepo will run the `build` command defined in each package's `package.json` file. Turborepo runs each `build` in parallel and caches & hashes the output to speed up future builds.\r\n\r\nFor `acme-core`, the `build` command is the following:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ntsup src/index.tsx --format esm,cjs --dts --external react\r\n```\r\n\r\n`tsup` compiles `src/index.tsx`, which exports all of the components in the design system, into both ES Modules and CommonJS formats as well as their TypeScript types. The `package.json` for `acme-core` then instructs the consumer to select the correct format:\r\n\r\n```json:acme-core/package.json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"@acme/core\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\r\n  \"main\": \"./dist/index.js\",\r\n  \"module\": \"./dist/index.mjs\",\r\n  \"types\": \"./dist/index.d.ts\",\r\n  \"sideEffects\": false,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `yarn build` to confirm compilation is working correctly. You should see a folder `acme-core/dist` which contains the compiled output.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nacme-core\r\n└── dist\r\n    ├── index.t.ts  <-- Types\r\n    ├── index.js    <-- CommonJS version\r\n    └── index.mjs   <-- ES Modules version\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Components\r\n\r\nEach file inside of `acme-core/src` is a component inside our design system. For example:\r\n\r\n```tsx:acme-core/src/Button.tsx\r\nimport * as React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport interface ButtonProps {\r\n  children: React.ReactNode;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function Button(props: ButtonProps) {\r\n  return <button>{props.children}</button>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nButton.displayName = 'Button';\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen adding a new file, ensure the component is also exported from the entry `index.tsx` file:\r\n\r\n```tsx:acme-core/src/index.tsx\r\nimport * as React from \"react\";\r\nexport { Button, type ButtonProps } from \"./Button\";\r\n// Add new component exports here\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Storybook\r\n\r\nStorybook provides us with an interactive UI playground for our components. This allows us to preview our components in the browser and instantly see changes when developing locally. This example preconfigures Storybook to:\r\n\r\n- Use Vite to bundle stories instantly (in milliseconds)\r\n- Automatically find any stories inside the `stories/` folder\r\n- Support using module path aliases like `@acme/core` for imports\r\n- Write MDX for component documentation pages\r\n\r\nFor example, here's the included Story for our `Button` component:\r\n\r\n```js:apps/docs/stories/button.stories.mdx\r\nimport { Button } from '@acme/core/src';\r\nimport { Meta, Story, Preview, Props } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';\r\n\r\n<Meta title=\"Components/Button\" component={Button} />\r\n\r\n# Button\r\n\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec euismod, nisl eget consectetur tempor, nisl nunc egestas nisi, euismod aliquam nisl nunc euismod.\r\n\r\n## Props\r\n\r\n<Props of={Box} />\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n<Preview>\r\n  <Story name=\"Default\">\r\n    <Button>Hello</Button>\r\n  </Story>\r\n</Preview>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example includes a few helpful Storybook scripts:\r\n\r\n- `yarn dev`: Starts Storybook in dev mode with hot reloading at `localhost:6006`\r\n- `yarn build`: Builds the Storybook UI and generates the static HTML files\r\n- `yarn preview-storybook`: Starts a local server to view the generated Storybook UI\r\n\r\n## Versioning & Publishing Packages\r\n\r\nThis example uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions, create changelogs, and publish to npm. It's preconfigured so you can start publishing packages immediatley.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to create an `NPM_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` and add it to your GitHub repository settings to enable access to npm. It's also worth installing the [Changesets bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) on your repository.\r\n\r\n### Generating the Changelog\r\n\r\nTo generate your changelog, run `yarn changeset` locally:\r\n\r\n1. **Which packages would you like to include?** – This shows which packages and changed and which have remained the same. By default, no packages are included. Press `space` to select the packages you want to include in the `changeset`.\r\n1. **Which packages should have a major bump?** – Press `space` to select the packages you want to bump versions for.\r\n1. If doing the first major version, confirm you want to release.\r\n1. Write a summary for the changes.\r\n1. Confirm the changeset looks as expected.\r\n1. A new Markdown file will be created in the `changeset` folder with the summary and a list of the packages included.\r\n\r\n### Releasing\r\n\r\nWhen you push your code to GitHub, the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action) will run the `release` script defined in the root `package.json`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nturbo run build --filter=docs^... && changeset publish\r\n```\r\n\r\nTurborepo runs the `build` script for all publishable packages (excluding docs) and publishes the packages to npm. By default, this example includes `acme` as the npm organization. To change this, do the following:\r\n\r\n- Rename folders in `packages/*` to replace `acme` with your desired scope\r\n- Search and replace `acme` with your desired scope\r\n- Re-run `yarn install`\r\n\r\nTo publish packages to a private npm organization scope, **remove** the following from each of the `package.json`'s\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- \"publishConfig\": {\r\n-  \"access\": \"public\"\r\n- },\r\n```\r\n",

It’s a principle that engineers strive to adhere to — preventing code duplication by abstracting shared functionality out into its own place.\r\n\r\nAt [Hy-Vee](/blog/joining-hy-vee), we reached a point where we were spinning up new teams extremely quickly and needed to maintain consistency across products. How could we ensure every person created a button that looked and functioned the same way across all digital properties?\r\n\r\nOur first step in tackling this problem was having UI/UX define a style guide that all consumers should implement. We needed a simple approach to ensure the adoption of our style guide and a set of shared components consumers could use without having to worry about styling.\r\n\r\n## Developing a Plan\r\n\r\nWe decided to build a reusable UI component library which will be consumed in all of our client-facing applications. This project had a few main goals:\r\n\r\n1. **Create consistency across the organization**\r\n\r\n   - All digital properties should look and feel the same, implementing our agreed upon style guide.\r\n\r\n2. **Improve the overall quality of our codebase**\r\n\r\n   - Having a shared set of UI components means less custom code for consumers.\r\n   - We can ensure all components meet our accessibility requirements.\r\n   - Components become hardened by multiple teams contributing to bug fixes and improvements.\r\n\r\n3. **Increase developer proficiency**\r\n\r\n   - Developers not specialized in CSS don’t have to worry about CSS quirks or cross-browser issues.\r\n   - Allow us to ship new products and rewrite legacy products faster.\r\n   - Decrease the amount of time it takes new employees to build UIs correctly.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these goals, we chose to use [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) as the base of the library. styled-components uses ES6 tagged template literals and CSS to allow you to write _real_ CSS code in your components instead of using JS objects.\r\n\r\nIt’s used by companies like Bloomberg, Atlassian, Reddit, Patreon, Target, Coinbase, and [more](https://github.com/styled-components/awesome-styled-components/blob/master/README.md#real-apps). There’s a variety of CSS in JS solutions, as outlined very succinctly [here](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js). After reviewing this list and reading the styled-components documentation, it seemed like a no-brainer for our use case. Some big wins for us:\r\n\r\n- Feels like writing traditional CSS vs. JavaScript objects\r\n- React & React Native support\r\n- Auto-prefixing vendor styles\r\n- Scoped styles eliminate global CSS conflicts\r\n\r\n## Building the Library\r\n\r\nLet’s take a look at a simple example: a button.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst BaseButton = styled.button`\r\n  border-radius: 4px;\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n  font-size: 1rem;\r\n  padding: 8px 32px;\r\n`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf it looks familiar, that’s because it should. It’s truly CSS without anything extra on top. Using the template string, [it invokes the styled.button function](https://mxstbr.blog/2016/11/styled-components-magic-explained/) and passes in the CSS string. This button makes it extremely easy for consumers to use (as shown below).\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<BaseButton>{'Hello World!'}</BaseButton>\r\n```\r\n\r\nA component library doesn’t have just one type of button, though. Let’s explore how we can extend this `BaseButton` component.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Button = styled(BaseButton)`\r\n  background: #e21c11;\r\n  border: none;\r\n  color: #fff;\r\n\r\n  :hover,\r\n  :focus {\r\n    background: #af0000;\r\n  }\r\n`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can pass the existing `BaseButton` into `styled` to build our primary colored button using our main brand color.\r\n\r\n## Using Props\r\n\r\nExtending isn’t the only way we can modify our base component.\r\nWe can also conditionally change styles based on the props passed in.\r\nLet’s explore adding a `disabled` state to our `Button` component.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n${(props) => props.disabled && css`\r\n    opacity: 0.25;\r\n    cursor: not-allowed;\r\n`}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we can pass in `disabled` as a prop when invoking the component.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Button disabled>{'Hello World!'}</Button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Utilizing JavaScript & React\r\n\r\nThere’s so much more we can do with our components.\r\n\r\nLet’s look at a more complicated example. We want to build an `Input` component, but abstract away the tricky parts for consumers.\r\nAll inputs should have a label, which needs to reference the actual `<input>` element by ID.\r\nWe also need to ensure the proper `aria-labels` are added for accessibility.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst Input = ({ disabled, id, label, placeholder, required }) => (\r\n  <Container>\r\n    <Label htmlFor={id} required={required}>\r\n      {label}\r\n    </Label>\r\n    <Input\r\n      aria-label={label}\r\n      aria-required={required}\r\n      disabled={disabled}\r\n      id={id}\r\n      placeholder={placeholder}\r\n      type=\"text\"\r\n    />\r\n  </Container>\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, it’s much easier for consumers to properly build accessible forms with the correct styling.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Input\r\n  disabled={false}\r\n  id=\"first-name\"\r\n  label=\"First Name\"\r\n  placeholder=\"Please enter your name\"\r\n  required\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nWe utilize [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for [Snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing#snapshot-testing-with-jest). This works particularly well with this library because it’s presentational. Our snapshots are expecting the visual properties (i.e. CSS styling) are being correctly conditionally applied.\r\n\r\nFor each permutation of a component (e.g. different props), we have a separate snapshot such that all conditions are covered.\r\nSnapshot output is made more readable using [jest-styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/jest-styled-components).\r\nFor more information, read _\"[Effective testing of styled-components with Jest Snapshots](https://medium.com/styled-components/effective-testing-for-styled-components-67982eb7d42b)\"_.\r\n\r\nSnapshots do not cover every scenario, however.\r\nIf we were to add `onClick` logic to a `Button` for example, we would want to utilize traditional testing methods to ensure the correct actions happen.\r\n\r\n## Distributing\r\n\r\nUsing [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), we can compile and generate a `dist` that can be published to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).\r\n\r\nThanks to [babel-plugin-styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/babel-plugin-styled-components), we get these (and more) for free:\r\n\r\n- Generated class names are prefixed with the file and component name for an improved debugging experience.\r\n- [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) shows `Button` instead of `styled.button`.\r\n\r\nHere’s our `.babelrc` file.\r\n\r\n```js:.babelrc\r\n{\r\n    \"presets\": [\"@babel/preset-env\", \"@babel/preset-react\"],\r\n    \"plugins\": [\"babel-plugin-styled-components\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nWe wanted to make it as easy as possible for others at Hy-Vee to contribute. That’s why all formatting and linting is taken care of with:\r\n\r\n- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)\r\n- [Stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint)\r\n- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)\r\n\r\nThanks to git pre-commit hooks with [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky), we’re ensured all code is formatted correctly before getting pushed to GitHub.\r\n\r\n## IDE Integration\r\n\r\nThere are even extensions for your favorite IDE to have CSS syntax highlighting inside of the JS template strings. Thanks, styled-components! 🎉\r\n\r\n- [vscode-styled-components](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components)\r\n- [webstorm-styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/webstorm-styled-components)\r\n- [Other IDEs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/tooling#syntax-highlighting)\r\n\r\n## Storybook\r\n\r\n[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) provides us with an interactive UI playground for our components. This makes development a breeze and also allows us to publish our Storybook to GitHub Pages using the [Storybook Deployer](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook-deployer#readme). That way anyone can explore the components and see consumption examples without having to dive into the code.\r\n\r\nAnother bonus feature of using Storybook are its add-ons. You’ll notice in the bottom pane we’ve chosen to use:\r\n\r\n- [Story Source](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/storysource) for showing code consumption examples\r\n- [Viewport](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/viewport) for allowing us to test different screen sizes and devices\r\n- [a11y](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/next/addons/a11y) for ensuring our components are accessible\r\n- [storybook-readme](https://github.com/tuchk4/storybook-readme) so our documentation lives alongside the component\r\n- [addon-knobs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storybook/addon-knobs) so we can dynamically edit props\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Storybook Example`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/ui-component-library-with-styled-components/example.gif`}\r\n  width={1575}\r\n  height={1027}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Future Plans & Roadmap\r\n\r\nWe’re working to have this library adopted across all web and mobile applications at Hy-Vee.\r\n\r\nAs we’ve built out this library, it’s prompted us to think deeply about our component architecture and strategy. We’re working to define what set of components makes sense for all consumers to implement and which should be their own separate entities.\r\n\r\nThis has inspired us to implement a [monorepo](/blog/turborepo-design-system-monorepo) design where we can easily develop and publish a large number of packages.\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\n> In this series, you will learn how to [create a dashboard](/dashboard) using Next.js API routes and integrate with third-party APIs.\r\n\r\n<Unsplash />\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) is the largest source of high-quality images on the internet.\r\nAmateur and professional photographers give back by allowing their photos to be used [100% free](https://unsplash.com/license) for commercial and non-commercial usage.\r\n\r\nThey also provide a [fantastic API](https://unsplash.com/developers), which gives you access to millions of photographs and a variety of metrics.\r\nAs an [Unsplash contributor](https://unsplash.com/@leerob), I wanted to see how many times my photos have been viewed and downloaded.\r\n\r\n## Getting Access to Unsplash\r\n\r\nTo gain access to the Unsplash API, you need to:\r\n\r\n- [Create an account.](https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account)\r\n- Go to [your applications](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications).\r\n- Click \"New Application.\"\r\n- Accept the terms of usage.\r\n- Fill in the required details.\r\n- Retrieve the access token for your new application.\r\n\r\n**That's it!** 🎉 You now have access to make requests to the Unsplash API with your access token.\r\n\r\n## Creating an environment variable\r\n\r\nTo securely access the API, we need to include the access token with each request.\r\nWe also _do not_ want to commit this value to git, so let's use an environment variable.\r\n\r\nSince I'm deploying with [Vercel](https://vercel.com), I can add the environment variable with the CLI.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ vercel env add unsplash-access-token <value>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo use it when running locally, add it to your `.env` (or `.env.local`) file.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nUNSPLASH_ACCESS_TOKEN=<value>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can now reference the value via `process.env.UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` in our API route.\r\n\r\n## Creating the API Route\r\n\r\nLet's start by creating a new API Route at `pages/api/unsplash.js`.\r\n\r\nWe want to pull statistics for a given user and return the total number of downloads and views.\r\nWe can use the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation#get-a-users-statistics) to retrieve this information.\r\n\r\n_Bonus_: We can cache the API Route with the [cache-control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) header.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\r\n  const accessToken = process.env.UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY;\r\n  const response = await fetch(\r\n    `https://api.unsplash.com/users/leerob/statistics?client_id=${accessToken}`,\r\n    {\r\n      method: 'GET'\r\n    }\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  const unsplashdata = await response.json();\r\n\r\n  res.setHeader(\r\n    'Cache-Control',\r\n    'public, s-maxage=1200, stale-while-revalidate=600'\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  return res.status(200).json({\r\n    downloads: unsplashdata.downloads.total,\r\n    views: unsplashdata.views.total\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nThe two cards below talk to `/api/unsplash` and pull back stats about my Unsplash account.\r\n\r\n<Unsplash />\r\n\r\n## Keep Reading\r\n\r\n**Create a Dashboard with Next.js API Routes**\r\n\r\n- Part 1 - [Unsplash API](/blog/unsplash-api-nextjs)\r\n- Part 2 - [YouTube API](/blog/youtube-api-nextjs)\r\n- Part 3 - [Google Analytics API](/blog/google-analytics-api-nextjs)\r\n- Part 4 - [Fetching Data with SWR](/blog/fetching-data-with-swr)\r\n",

    "publishedAt": "2019-01-13",
    "summary": "Learn how to use Mapbox with Next.js to create a non-SSR map component that is free up to 50,000 map views per month.",
    "image": "/static/images/using-mapbox-with-next-js/banner.png",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\r\nIn the process of selecting a mapping library for [dsmtech.io](https://dsmtech.io), I ran into a\r\nnumber of roadblocks. First and foremost, Google Maps has **drastically** changed their [pricing structure](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/user-guide/pricing-changes/).\r\n\r\n> \"On June 11, 2018, we launched new Maps, Routes and Places functionality, which changes the way certain APIs and features are billed. Then on July 16, 2018, all API and feature prices changed to align with our pricing table.\"\r\n\r\nAs you can imagine, a lot of people [are upset](http://geoawesomeness.com/developers-up-in-arms-over-google-maps-api-insane-price-hike/). In the past 6 months, I've stumbled onto a lot of projects that were\r\nusing Google Maps that no longer work. This really puts a hindrance on side projects. Thus, I needed a different solution for my mapping library.\r\n\r\n## Mapbox\r\n\r\nUltimately, I decided to use [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).\r\n\r\n- It uses [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) under the hood, which is [open-source](/blog/why-i-create-open-source-software).\r\n- It has simple pay-as-you-go pricing.\r\n- It's free up to _50,000 map views per month_.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Mapbox Pricing`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/using-mapbox-with-next-js/mapbox-pricing.png`}\r\n  width={817}\r\n  height={339}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Next.js\r\n\r\nI love [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). This blog is actually [written with it](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io). If you've never\r\nheard of Next, here are some of the big wins for me.\r\n\r\n- Automatic transpilation and bundling (with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)).\r\n- Automatic code splitting.\r\n- Hot code reloading.\r\n- Server-side rendering ([SSR](https://medium.com/@benjburkholder/javascript-seo-server-side-rendering-vs-client-side-rendering-bc06b8ca2383)) out of the box.\r\n- Static file serving.\r\n\r\nIf that sounds awesome, follow their [quick-start guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/) to get an application up and running.\r\nFor now, let's assume you already have your Next application working.\r\n\r\n_**Just want the code?** You can view a working example [here](https://next-mapbox-demo.now.sh) and the code [here](https://github.com/leerob/next-mapbox-demo)._\r\n\r\n## Mapbox + Next.js\r\n\r\nWe'll take advantage of the wonderful [react-map-gl](https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl) library created by Uber.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nyarn add react-map-gl\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, let's create a simple Map component at `components/Map.js`.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport { Component } from 'react';\r\nimport ReactMapGL from 'react-map-gl';\r\n\r\nclass Map extends Component {\r\n  state = {\r\n    viewport: {\r\n      width: '100vw',\r\n      height: '100vh',\r\n      latitude: 41.5868,\r\n      longitude: -93.625,\r\n      zoom: 13\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <ReactMapGL\r\n        mapStyle=\"mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v9\"\r\n        mapboxApiAccessToken=\"YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN_HERE\"\r\n        onViewportChange={(viewport) => this.setState({ viewport })}\r\n        {...this.state.viewport}\r\n      />\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Map;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** You will need to create a Mapbox account and generate a [token](https://github.com/uber/react-map-gl#about-mapbox-tokens).\r\n\r\nMapbox uses the global `window` object under the hood, which means it can't be server-side rendered. Thus, we need to make some modifications to get things working.\r\n\r\nNext now supports [dynamic imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/#dynamic-import), which make it easy to selectively render components\r\non the client-side. Let's modify our `pages/index.js` file, or whichever route you want to render the `Map` component.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic';\r\n\r\nconst DynamicComponentWithNoSSR = dynamic(() => import('../components/Map'), {\r\n  ssr: false\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default () => <DynamicComponentWithNoSSR />;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, you'll need to include the Mapbox CSS file in your application. You can do this in a variety of ways.\r\nI chose to override `_app.js` and include it in the `<head>` [like so](https://github.com/leerob/next-mapbox-demo/blob/master/pages/_app.js#L29).\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<link\r\n  href=\"https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v0.51.0/mapbox-gl.css\"\r\n  rel=\"stylesheet\"\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point, you should be able to run `yarn dev` (which runs `next`) to see the map working.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Mapbox Demo with Next.js`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/using-mapbox-with-next-js/map.png`}\r\n  width={1000}\r\n  height={645}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Going Further\r\n\r\nOkay, we've got a map. Now what? Here are some other ideas for going further.\r\n\r\n- When importing dynamic components, you can supply a [loading placeholder](https://nextjs.org/docs/#2-with-custom-loading-component). [Here's an example](/blog/loading-placeholder-with-sass) of one you could create.\r\n- You can use [Marker](https://uber.github.io/react-map-gl/#/Documentation/api-reference/marker) from `react-map-gl` to place items on the map.\r\n",

      "raw": "\r\n> In this series, you will learn how to [create a dashboard](/dashboard) using Next.js API routes and integrate with third-party APIs.\r\n\r\n<YouTube />\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n[YouTube](https://youtube.com) has cemented itself as the number one video sharing platform. Its vibrant community of creators is growing exponentially.\r\n\r\nTracking metrics about your channel is an integral part of measuring your success.\r\nYouTube provides [a Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs), which allows you to integrate the platform directly into your website.\r\nSince I'm a [YouTube Creator](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZMli3czZnd1uoc1ShTouQw), I wanted to see how many times my subscriber count and views directly on my site.\r\n\r\n## Getting Access to YouTube\r\n\r\nTo gain access to the YouTube API, you need to:\r\n\r\n- Go to the [Google Developer Console.](https://console.developers.google.com/)\r\n- Create a new project.\r\n- Credentials -> Create Credentials -> Service-account key.\r\n- Click \"Enable APIs and services.\"\r\n- Find \"YouTube Data API v3\" and enable it.\r\n\r\nSince we're communicating server-to-server, we'll need a [service account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount).\r\n\r\n- Go to your [service accounts](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page.\r\n- Create a service account.\r\n- Click \"Create Key\" and choose JSON.\r\n\r\nYou should now have a JSON file similar to this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"service_account\",\r\n  \"project_id\": \"...\",\r\n  \"private_key_id\": \"...\",\r\n  \"private_key\": \"...\",\r\n  \"client_email\": \"...\",\r\n  \"client_id\": \"...\",\r\n  \"auth_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\",\r\n  \"token_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token\",\r\n  \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs\",\r\n  \"client_x509_cert_url\": \"...\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe use this key later to set up our client in our API Route.\r\nOkay, back to the [service account](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).\r\nWe need to delegate [domain-wide authority](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#delegatingauthority).\r\n\r\n- On the table row, click Actions -> Edit.\r\n- Show Domain-Wide Delegation -> Enable G-Suite Domain-Wide Delegation.\r\n\r\n**That's it!** 🎉 You now have access to make requests to the YouTube API with your service account.\r\n\r\n## Creating an environment variable\r\n\r\nTo securely access the API, we need to include the secret with each request.\r\nWe also _do not_ want to commit secrets to git. Thus, we should use an environment variable.\r\n\r\nSince I'm deploying with [Vercel](https://vercel.com), I can add the secrets via their CLI.\r\nWe only need a few of the values from the JSON file. For the private key, make sure you convert\r\nthe new line characters (`\\n`) to actual new lines.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ vc secret add -- google-private-key \"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\r\nMIIEvQIBA\r\n..\r\n..\r\n2DAVOW4c=\r\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\"\r\n$ vc secret add google-client-email my-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com\r\n$ vc secret add google-client-id 721877721877\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo reference these values locally when using `vc dev`, they need to be added to your `.env` file.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nGOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=\"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\nDVOW4c=\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n\"\r\nGOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=my-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we need to add the secrets to our `vercel.json`.\r\n\r\n```json:vercel.json\r\n{\r\n  \"env\": {\r\n    \"GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY\": \"@google-private-key\",\r\n    \"GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL\": \"@google-client-email\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can now reference the secrets via `process.env.GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` in our API route.\r\n\r\n_Note_: If you have a lot of environment variables in Vercel, you might need to [encrpyt your service account](https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-do-i-workaround-vercel-s-4-kb-environment-variables-limit).\r\n\r\n## Creating the API Route\r\n\r\nLet's start by creating a new API route at `pages/api/youtube.js`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default (req, res) => {\r\n  return res.status(200).json({});\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make server-side requests to YouTube, we can install the [googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client) library.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ yarn add googleapis@48.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we can initialize `googleapis` inside our API route.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { google } from 'googleapis';\r\n\r\nlet googleAuth;\r\n\r\nexport default async (_, res) => {\r\n  googleAuth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({\r\n    credentials: {\r\n      client_email: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL,\r\n      private_key: process.env.GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY\r\n    },\r\n    scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly']\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  const youtube = google.youtube({\r\n    auth: googleAuth,\r\n    version: 'v3'\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return res.status(200).json({});\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we want to pull statistics for a given channel and return the total number of subscribers and views.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { google } from 'googleapis';\r\n\r\nlet googleAuth;\r\n\r\nexport default async (_, res) => {\r\n  googleAuth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({\r\n    credentials: {\r\n      client_email: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL,\r\n      private_key: process.env.GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY\r\n    },\r\n    scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly']\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  const youtube = google.youtube({\r\n    auth: googleAuth,\r\n    version: 'v3'\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  const response = await youtube.channels.list({\r\n    id: 'UCZMli3czZnd1uoc1ShTouQw',\r\n    part: 'statistics'\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  const channel = response.data.items[0];\r\n  const { subscriberCount, viewCount } = channel.statistics;\r\n\r\n  return res.status(200).json({\r\n    subscriberCount,\r\n    viewCount\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nThe two cards below talk to `/api/youtube` and pull back stats about my YouTube account.\r\n\r\n_Bonus_: You can cache the API route with the [cache-control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) header.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nCache-Control: public, max-age=120, stale-while-revalidate=60\r\n```\r\n\r\n<YouTube />\r\n\r\n## Keep Reading\r\n\r\n**Create a Dashboard with Next.js API Routes**\r\n\r\n- Part 1 - [Unsplash API](/blog/unsplash-api-nextjs)\r\n- Part 2 - [YouTube API](/blog/youtube-api-nextjs)\r\n- Part 3 - [Google Analytics API](/blog/google-analytics-api-nextjs)\r\n- Part 4 - [Fetching Data with SWR](/blog/fetching-data-with-swr)\r\n",
