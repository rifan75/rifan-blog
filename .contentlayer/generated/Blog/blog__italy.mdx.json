It seemed too good to be true.\r\n\r\nMy fiancÃ©e and I decided to pull the trigger after realizing how many unused credit card reward points we had. There were only 4 seats left, so we quickly scrambled to grab our passports and fill out the information.\r\nWe'd be starting and ending in Venice - the rest we would figure out later. A few minutes later, it was finalized.\r\n\r\nWe were going to Italy! ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹\r\n\r\n## Why Backpacking?\r\n\r\nI love minimalism, especially in regards to traveling. Lugging around two checked bags and a carry-on is expensive and often unnecessary.\r\nPlus, we knew we'd be going from planes to trains and doing a decent amount of walking.\r\n\r\nWe had heard good things about [Tom Bihn's Aeronaut 45](https://www.tombihn.com/products/aeronaut-45?variant=34039227783) backpack from a friend.\r\nIt's the maximum carry-on size most airlines accept and is very versatile. It can be worn as a backpack or carried like a bag.\r\nThere are ample pockets and containers to organize and store your belongings. It was a perfect match.\r\n\r\nWe were able to fit 10 days of clothes, shoes, toiletries, and photography gear into our respective bags with ease. The backpack straps were comfortable enough to support long walks.\r\nOverall, I would highly recommend this bag for others considering downsizing their luggage.\r\n\r\n## Venice\r\n\r\nAfter a pretty seamless overnight flight connecting through Chicago, we arrived in Venice in the morning.\r\nThis might be an unpopular opinion, but I _love_ airplane food on international flights. It could be the lack of other options, but it always hits the spot ðŸ’¯\r\n\r\nShortly after landing, we got some euros out of the ATM (_\\*bancomat_) and caught a bus to Venezia Mestre.\r\nOur Airbnb was only a few blocks from the Mestre train station. We chose to stay outside of the main city center to avoid some of the tourists and get a cheaper rate.\r\nTraveling into the city via train was fairly simple, even for unexperienced train passengers.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Mestre to Venice Train`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/train.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1000}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nVenice's gritty landscape, unique alleyways, and water taxis were charming. However, even outside the busy summer months, it was still very touristy.\r\nWe nabbed some fresh pizza and spent the rest of the afternoon exploring the canals.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Venice, Italy`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/venice.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1000}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nSome parts of Venice were very dirty and using the public restroom was not an enjoyable experience.\r\nI wouldn't recommend more than a few days in Venice - but I'm glad we saw it.\r\n\r\n## CinquÃ© Terre\r\n\r\nWe rose early the next morning to catch a series of trains to Manarola.\r\nWe went through Florence and La Spezia before finally arriving in Manarola. It took about 4 hours in total.\r\n\r\nThe [Trenitalia](https://trenitalia.com) trails with designated seats were excellent. We sat back, relaxed, and took in the countryside.\r\nThe regional trains... not so much. We were packed like sardines on the two-hour leg from Florence to La Spezia.\r\nAlas, we arrived in Manarola with the afternoon ahead of us.\r\n\r\nWe trekked up and down the steep city streets searching for a place to eat.\r\nAfter eating the most amazing pesto gnocchi I've ever had (seriously), we grabbed two cones of fresh gelato across the street.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Gelato`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/gelato.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1000}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThe laid-back pace of Manarola was more of the vibe we were looking for.\r\nThe city by the sea had exquisite character, from the small gift shops to the unique houses airing their laundry out to dry on the balcony.\r\nHaving a few drinks didn't hurt, either.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Manarola`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/manarola.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1000}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nThat night, we both struggled to sleep. Our sleep schedule still hadn't caught up from the 7-hour time change.\r\nThe next morning we rose early and went on a brisk hike up the mountain-side for a better view of the city.\r\nThe crisp ocean air, sunny skies, and 70-degree weather made it worth the steep incline.\r\n\r\nTo cool off from the hike, we took a brisk dip in the Mediterranean Sea. It wasn't exactly _warm_.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Swimming at Manarola`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/swimming.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1000}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nOne of the highlights of the trip was the unbelievable sunset we witnessed.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Cinque Terre Sunset`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/sunset.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1000}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nWhen I look back on CinquÃ© Terre, I'll remember a few things: pesto gnocchi, chocolate chip gelato, and the amazing views.\r\n\r\n## Naples\r\n\r\nOur next destination was the Almafi Coast, but we wanted to break up the travel day to be a bit shorter.\r\nWe decided to stop for a quick night in Naples before heading out early for the Almafi Coast.\r\n\r\nNaples is the 3rd largest city in Italy. I can't really summarize the entire city in our short time there,\r\nbut our experience was pretty average. Highlights include excellent pizza, great wine, and a short walk to the train station.\r\nEverything else was pretty lackluster. There are definitely some sketchy areas and questionable people.\r\nI'm not sure it's fair to judge the entire city based on this, but I'm not sure I would recommend it.\r\n\r\nWhile in Naples, we met up with our two friends Clare and Liz. They joined us for our stay in Praiano.\r\n\r\n## Praiano (Almafi Coast)\r\n\r\nThe Almafi Coast consists of a handful of towns, but the most famous by far is Positano.\r\nYou've probably seen a picture similar to this before. It's iconic.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Positano, Italy`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/positano.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1125}\r\n/>\r\n\r\nOur decision to stay in Praiano over Positano was mostly based on cost.\r\nAn added bonus of this was being just far away from the main tourist areas. At night, we sat on our balcony and listened to the ocean in silence. It was beautiful.\r\n\r\nOne of the _best_ decisions we made was to hire a private transfer from Naples to Praiano.\r\nThere isn't really a direct route to Praiano or Positano. We could have also taken the train into Sorrento and then got a transfer or taken the water taxi.\r\nBut why bother?\r\nOur driver was prompt and did an excellent job of navigating the tight, windy roads and erratic drivers.\r\nRenting a car would have been an expensive mistake. I would highly recommend [Daytrip](https://mydaytrip.com/) - it's what we used.\r\n\r\nGroceries and restaurants were a short walk away (but with steep inclines, ouch).\r\nThe grocery stores were very affordable in Praiano, especially splitting between the four of us.\r\n\r\nI'd highly recommend getting out on the water if you can. We did a boat tour out to the island of Capri, which was fantastic.\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`On a boat in Positano, Italy`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/boat.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={2250}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<Image\r\n  alt={`Capri, Italy`}\r\n  src={`/static/images/italy/capri.jpg`}\r\n  width={1500}\r\n  height={1875}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Quick Tips\r\n\r\nIf you're planning to head to Italy, here's a few things you should know (plus some general travel tips):\r\n\r\n- Keep tabs on flights and [track prices](https://support.google.com/travel/answer/6235879?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).\r\n- Ideally, book your lodging months in advance for the best rates. I'd suggest a mix of Airbnb/Hotels depending on the location.\r\n- Make sure you get an [outlet converter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L87GPPT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\r\n- Electricity in Italy conforms to the European standard of 220V to 230V, with a frequency of 50Hz. Don't plug an electric razor in without checking if it's dual-voltage ðŸ˜²\r\n- If you haven't already, consider getting [TSA Precheck](https://www.tsa.gov/precheck) / [Global Entry](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry).\r\n- Ensure your credit card doesn't have international fees.\r\n- I would recommend taking out some euros ahead of time or at the airport. There will be places that don't accept a credit card.\r\n- Use [Google Translate](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-translate/id414706506) and download Italian offline, in case of spotty coverage.\r\n- If you use Spotify, consider downloading some playlists offline as well.\r\n- Check into your flight as early as possible!\r\n",
